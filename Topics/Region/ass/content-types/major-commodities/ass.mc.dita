Each production table shows estimates of output for the world and, generally, for sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, the table lists the main regional producing countries and, for comparison, the leading producers from outside the continent.</commodities-note>

          <!--This appears in all four regions (copy to FEA). FYI: bauxite is the mined ore; alumina is refined from the ore; and (primary) aluminium is the smelted metal. USGS deals with each separately; we mainly use bauxite and, a bit, aluminum. From USGS, you will need bauxite (By Commodity, then B for Bauxite) and the Bauxite and Alumina Summary (Mineral Commodity Summaries pdf, dated the current year) and Minerals Yearbook section (listed below, a year or two before check the date on the bottom of the first page to check it updated since last Europa update). I suggest opening both in separate windows. Later, you will need USGS aluminum, for the Summary, and the Yearbook chapter for the countries (Countries dropdown, grouped by region). Text: the blurb about reserves can be updated from the bauxite Summary. Table: use Summary and Yearbook - check the dates, but Yearbook usually more recent so update every year but the most recent one, then use the Summary for the figures from the latest year (if no Yearbook update, use Summary for the two years). You have a few n.a.s here, because most African producers are minor ones, so you cannot convincingly provide a regional total just from the Summary. The World Market and Region (WMR) text: the blurb on the largest companies just depends on an internet search - the sources cited might provide updates - but it is not the end of the world if they are not updated every year. Keep an eye out for major mergers and big names disappearing. USGS, in the blurbs in the bauxite and aluminum Yearbooks, might mention largest companies, but this will be a bit dated. The text moves on from bauxite to talk about aluminium (i.e. smelter production), so you need the aluminum Summary. Keep that open on your screen. Generally, for country specific stuff on smaller countries that are not mentioned in the Summary sheets, use the less recent data from the commodity or the country Yearbook, blurbs or tables. I used to update the share of bauxite/aluminium in the total exports of a country from the Europa chapters, but the stats increasingly just report bland overall categories now, even when countries are overwhelmingly dependent on particular minerals or whatever. You will have to Google, if you do not have access to a trade stats source. Some countries here just produce primary aluminium, which means a bit of faffing about with the USGS aluminum section, as well as bauxite ones. Global Forum: you need to check the membership details on IAI website. Prices: use the Pink Sheet data, the annual spreadsheet for the first column and the monthly one to see the highest and lowest for last year. Look at monthly trends so as to update the last sentence or two of the blurb (or you might have read something somewhere, such as in the USGS summary or something). Always check the numbers in the year before; sometimes they get slightly adjusted. Always check the series has not been changed (the Pink Sheet pdf has footnotes citing the specifics of the price quoted, as in our blurb. This type of price series in our surveys includes benchmarks every five years, then the most recent three years available. Once the earliest of the three years ends with a 6, it is time to decide whether to delete the earliest five-yearly figure. GWJ 08/17-->

      Aluminium (known as aluminum in the USA and, generally, Canada) is the second most abundant metallic element in the earth’s crust after silicon, comprising about 8% of the total. However, it is much less widely used than steel, despite having about the same strength and only half the weight. Aluminium has important applications as a metal because of its lightness, ease of fabrication and other desirable properties. Other products of alumina (aluminium oxide trihydrate, into which aluminium ore is refined) are materials in refractories, abrasives, glass manufacture, other ceramic products, catalysts and absorbers. Alumina hydrates are used for the production of aluminium chemicals, fire retardant in carpet backing, and industrial fillers in plastics and related products. Bauxite is the principal aluminium ore. Nepheline syenite, kaolin, shale, anorthosite and alunite are all potential alternative sources of alumina, but these are not currently economic to process. Of all bauxite mined, approximately 85% is converted to alumina (Al
      <sub>2</sub>
      O
      <sub>3</sub>
      ) for the production of aluminium metal. The developing countries, in which at least 70% of known bauxite reserves are located, supply some 60% of the ore required. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), in 2022 32% of potential world bauxite resources were located in Africa, 23% in Oceania, 21% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 18% in Asia.

          <p id="ASS.MC.3">The industry is structured in three stages: bauxite mining, alumina refining, and smelting. After mining, bauxite is fed direct to process if mine-run material is adequate (as in Jamaica), or else it is crushed and beneficiated. Where the ore `as mined’ presents handling problems, or weight reduction is desirable, it may be dried prior to shipment. The alumina is separated from the ore by the Bayer process, through precipitation from a chemical solution. The ratio of bauxite to alumina is approximately 1.95:1. The smelting of the aluminium from alumina is generally by electrolysis in molten cryolite. Owing to the high consumption of electricity by the smelting process, alumina is usually smelted in areas where low-cost electricity is available. However, most of the electricity now used in primary smelting in the Western world is generated by hydroelectricity—a renewable energy source.</p>

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       The high degree of `vertical integration’ (i.e. the control of successive stages of production) in the industry means that a significant proportion of trade in bauxite and alumina is in the form of intra-company transfers. The increasing tendency to site alumina refineries near to bauxite deposits has also resulted in a shrinking bauxite trade, but there is a growing free market in alumina, serving the needs of the increasing number of independent (i.e. non-integrated) smelters. The major markets for aluminium are in transportation, packaging, building and construction, electrical and other machinery and equipment, and consumer durables. Although the production of aluminium is energy intensive, its light weight results in a net saving, particularly in the transportation industry, where the use of the metal as a substitute for steel, in particular in the manufacture of road motor vehicles and components, is well established. Aluminium is valued by the aerospace industry for its weight saving characteristics and for its low cost relative to alternative materials. Aluminium-lithium alloys command considerable potential for use in this sector, although the traditional dominance of aluminium in the aerospace industry has been challenged since the 1990s by `composites’ such as carbonepoxy, a fusion of carbon fibres and hardened resins, the lightness and durability of which can exceed that of many aluminium alloys. The recycling of aluminium is economically, as well as environmentally, desirable, as the process uses only 5% of the electricity required to produce a similar quantity of primary aluminium. Recycling is of commercial significance in many countries, but the world leaders were Brazil, Japan and Argentina in the late 2010s.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.5">According to industry sources, in 2020 the largest bauxite-producing companies in the world, based on production volumes, were Rio Tinto Group (Australia/United Kingdom—the aluminium-related business is based in Canada, until 2015 under the name Rio Tinto Alcan), Alcoa (USA), Aluminium Corporation of China Ltd (Chinalco—especially its listed subsidiary, Chalco), United Company RUSAL (Russian Federation) and Hydro (Norway—Norsk Hydro). Many of the other major companies are located in countries boasting the availability of cheap power: Dubai Aluminium Co, China Power Investment Co, BHP Billiton (Australia/United Kingdom—in 2015 BHP bauxite and aluminium interests were spun off into a separate company, South32), Shandong Xinfa Aluminum and Electricity Group (People’s Republic of China) and Aluminium Bahrain BSC, or Alba. In 2020, according to industry analysts, based on primary aluminium production output, the largest companies were Chalco, Hongqiao (People’s Republic of China), United Company RUSAL (Russian Federation), Shandong Xinfa (People’s Republic of China) and Rio Tinto.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.6">In 2022, according to USGS estimates, the People’s Republic of China alone provided 58% of world smelter production of primary aluminium (40.0m. metric tons of a world total of 69.0m. tons), followed by India (6%), the Russian Federation (5%), Canada and the United Arab Emirates (4%), and Bahrain and Australia (2%). China displaced the USA as the most significant country for the international aluminium industry in the 2000s, accounting for about two-fifths of both consumption and production globally by 2013. By 2018, according to the USGS, the country accounted for 18% of semi-fabricated aluminium material imports (down from 33% in 2017). The USA was for many years the world’s principal producing country, but in 2001 US output of primary aluminium was surpassed by that of Russia and of China. By 2022 the USA had fallen to ninth place among world producers (just ahead of Iceland). In the same year, when smelter output was less than one-half that of 2015, production of primary aluminium by China was estimated to be close to 47 times that of the USA.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.11">Guinea possessed about 24% of the world’s known bauxite reserves in 2022, according to estimates by the USGS. The country is the world’s leading exporter of bauxite, mainly because other producers export more refined aluminium. Guinea once ranked second in the world, after Australia, in terms of ore production. Exports of aluminium ore and concentrate dominate the Guinean economy. In 2022 exports of aluminium ores and concentrates, valued at US&#160;$5,315m., contributed 62% of Guinea’s total revenue from foreign sales. Compagnie des Bauxites, CBG, accounted for 78% of bauxite production capacity in Guinea, while United Company RUSAL’s Alumina Co of Guinea (ACG) operated the country’s only alumina refinery near its Friguia mine until it closed in 2012. The refinery reopened in mid-2018. Contingent on returning political stability, international interest remained strong into the second half of the 2010s, but more in bauxite mining than ore processing, despite the Government being keen to encourage investment in refineries. Indeed, it was reported in mid-2023 that the Guinea Alumina Corporation (GAC) had signed a collaboration agreement with Aluminium Corporation of China (Chalco) to build another refinery. In mid-2019 Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA—of the United Arab Emirates—and GAC’s parent company) announced its first exports of bauxite ore . The project, reported to have cost some $1,400m. by mid-2019, represented the largest investment in undeveloped areas in Guinea for 40 years, and followed the same company’s introduction of its Al Taweelah refinery there in April. Mine production in Guinea had not been too badly affected by the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa from December 2013, because the minerals sector companies adopted robust measures to ensure continued output. From 2011 the Government was attempting to deal with governance issues in the mining sector and to instil investor confidence, and although international investment in bauxite mining continued, commodity prices remained problematic. Furthermore, popular impatience with alleged corruption and the failure of mining revenues to make any discernable difference to the lives of Guineans broke out in several days of rioting in the bauxite hub city of Boké in late April 2017, with protests triggered by a power failure and fuelled by complaints about pollution.</p>
          <p>Cameroon traditionally receives bauxite or alumina from Guinea for its smelter, but has its own extensive bauxite deposits, estimated at some 1,200m. metric tons, which await commercial exploitation. Compagnie Camérounaise de l’Aluminium, in which Rio Tinto and the Government have shares, produces primary aluminium at Edéa. Most significant mineral deposits in Cameroon are yet to be fully developed. Meanwhile, the country produced an estimated 80,000 tons of primary aluminium in 2021. Tanzania produces a small amount of bauxite (7,000 tons in 2018, but no mining output in 2019–20), while Malawi’s reserves of bauxite, located at Mulanje, have remained unexploited because of a lack of available power supply (an electricity grid connection with Mozambique remains the best hope to resolve the issue). The readier availability of energy in Mozambique enabled the major aluminium smelter project (Mozal), which was formally inaugurated in 1998, although the country is not a significant producer of bauxite (an estimated 5,000 metric tons in 2020, from the operations of Zimbabwean company E. C. Meikles in Manica province). The smelter was the largest single investment project in the country, and it cast its first aluminium in 2000, using alumina from Australia. Expansion of the smelter required contracts for secure and long-term electricity supplies from South Africa. Mozambique remains Africa’s second largest producer of primary aluminium (some 565,000 tons in 2021), after South Africa. In 2022 exports of aluminium and articles thereof (mainly to Europe) contributed 23% of Mozambique’s total export revenue (it was 62% in 2008). South Africa has no significant bauxite reserves, but also produces primary aluminium from imported alumina. In 2014 BHP Billiton closed one of the country’s two smelters at Richards Bay (Bayside), but retained the larger Hillside plant, run by South32 from 2015. Primary aluminium production in South Africa was 714,000 tons in 2021. Power supply reliability was an issue for the industry; alumina is mainly imported from Guinea. The value of South Africa’s exports of aluminium and articles thereof amounted to US&#160;$2,007m. in 2022.</p>
          <p>Ghana’s bauxite reserves have been estimated at 780m. metric tons. The country produces bauxite, and has a smelter that produces aluminium, but it has no refinery, so alumina has to be imported back into the country. The Government has therefore long been interested in developing a fully integrated system in Ghana. Bosai Minerals Group of China bought the Ghana Bauxite Co in 2010, having expressed support for an integrated aluminium industry, but the feasibility of that remained problematic, given anxieties about secure energy provision. The smelter at Tema, operated by the Volta Aluminium Co (Valco), is one of the largest in Africa, having a capacity of 200,000 metric tons, but at its peak production had absorbed 65% of the country’s electricity consumption. The plant was taken over by the Government in 2008, after it closed following several years of severe power shortages resulting from the effect of drought on the hydroelectric supply. Operations resumed in 2011, and in 2021 the smelter produced an estimated 30,000 tons of primary aluminium (compared to 42,000 tons two years earlier). Meanwhile, Sierra Leone had for a time displaced Ghana as Africa’s second largest bauxite producer, but output there fell in the 2010s. The country’s only mine was owned by Alum SA of Romania. Bauxite output increased substantially in recent years, to reach 1.9m. tons in 2018, before falling back down to 1.3m. tons in 2020.</p>
          <p>
               <b>Global Forum</b>
       The International Aluminium Institute (IAI), based in London, UK, is a global forum of producers of aluminium dedicated to the development and wider use of the metal. In 2023 the IAI had 25 member companies, representing every part of the world, including Russia and China, and responsible for more than 60% of global bauxite, alumina and aluminium production.

               <b>Prices</b>
       The international benchmark price for aluminium cited here and by the World Bank is the average settlement price (unalloyed primary ingots, high grade—minimum 99.7% purity) traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME). Aluminium prices were particularly affected by the global recession precipitated by the international financial crisis of 2008, with the average price falling to US&#160;$1,664.83 per metric ton for 2009, the lowest level since 2003. Recovery was strong, but average annual prices declined in 2011–13; an improvement in 2014 was not sustained into 2015–16, and in November of the earlier year prices reached the lowest nominal monthly price in six years. Meanwhile, the average annual price in 2016 was its lowest since 2003. A recovery took prices generally upwards over 2017–18 (reaching their highest point since early 2012 in October 2017—$2,131 per ton). However, prices began to fall again in late 2018 and continued to decline throughout 2019 and the first half of 2020. From early 2021 prices had begun to recover, rising throughout the year and into early 2022; by March of the latter year the price was averaging $3,498 per ton (the highest monthly price since June 1988); the high prices were a consequence of higher input costs (specifically fuel, caused by the ongoing Russia–Ukraine conflict) leading to supply disruption in many regions. Prices dropped thereafter (to $2,137 per ton in August 2023) as primary aluminium output in China increased following the cessation of its uncompromising COVID-19 containment policy in December 2022.

               <i>Manihot esculenta</i>

          <p id="ASS.MC.30">Cassava is a perennial woody shrub, up to 5&#160;m in height, which is cultivated mainly for its enlarged starch-rich roots, although the young shoots and leaves of the plant are also edible. The plant can be harvested at any time from seven months to three years after planting. A native of South and Central America, cassava is now one of the most important food plants in all parts of the tropics (except at the highest altitudes), having a wide range of adaptation for rainfall (500–8,000&#160;mm per year). Cassava is also well adapted to low-fertility soils, and grows where other crops will not. It is produced mainly on marginal agricultural land, with virtually no input of fertilizers, fungicides or insecticides.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.31">
      The varieties of the plant fall into two broad groups, bitter and sweet cassava, formerly classed as two separate species, 
      <i>Manihot utilissima</i>
       and 
      <i>M. dulcis</i>
       or 
      <i>aipi</i>
      . The roots of the sweet variety are usually boiled and then eaten. The roots of the bitter variety are either soaked, pounded and fermented to make a paste (such as `fufu’ in West Africa), or given an additional roasting to produce `gari’. They can also be made into flour and starch, or dried and pelletized as animal feed.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.32">The cassava plant contains two toxic substances, linamarin and lotaustralin, in its edible roots and leaves, which release the poison hydrocyanic acid, or cyanide, when plant tissues are damaged. Sweet varieties of cassava produce as little as 20&#160;mg of acid per kg of fresh roots, whereas bitter varieties may produce more than 1,000&#160;mg per kg. Although traditional methods of food preparation are effective in reducing cyanogenic content to harmless levels, if roots of bitter varieties are underprocessed and the diet lacks protein and iodine (as occurs during famines and wars), cyanide poisoning can cause fatalities. Despite the disadvantages of the two toxins, some farmers prefer to cultivate the bitter varieties, possibly because the cyanide helps to protect the plant from potential pests, and possibly because the texture of certain food products made from bitter varieties is preferred to that of sweet cassavas.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.33">Cassava, which was introduced to Africa from South America in the 16th century, is the most productive source of carbohydrates and produces more calories per unit of land than any cereal crop. Although the nutrient content of the roots consists almost entirely of starch, the leaves are high in vitamins, minerals and protein and, processed as meal or eaten as a fresh vegetable (`saka saka’), provide a useful source of nutrition in many parts of Africa, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Congo basin generally, Sierra Leone, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Tanzania and Uganda. A plot of cassava may be left unattended in the ground for two years after maturity without deterioration of the roots. As the plant is also resistant to prolonged drought it is valued as a famine reserve. The roots are highly perishable after harvest, however, and if not consumed immediately must be processed (into flour, starch, pellets, etc.). Cassava pellets are processed through grinding and extrusion from the original cassava chips (dried chopped and chipped roots) or processed into pellets in advance of drying. Pellets give off less dust and are therefore less polluting; they are also more compact and more uniform, making transportation easier and cheaper. Tapioca starch (sometimes called tapioca flour) is a starch extracted from cassava by washing and pulping—usually made from the fresh root by grating, mixing with water, sedimentation and drying—whereas cassava flour is the peeled, dried and ground root. Starch for ethanol production is usually made from cassava chips, either through wet milling or dry grinding. Tapioca starch is widely used in food processing and other industries, while chips and pellets are mainly used as animal feed.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.34">While the area under cassava has expanded considerably through the 2000s, there is increasing concern that the rapid expansion of cassava root planting may threaten the fertility of the soil and subsequently other crops. Under cropping systems where no fertilizer is used, cassava is the last crop in the succession because of its particular adaptability to infertile soils and its high nutrient use efficiency in yield terms (although there is now evidence to suggest that cassava yields increase with the use of fertilizer). Soil fertility is not threat­ened by cassava itself, but rather by cultivation systems that dispense with fertilizers.</p>

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       As a staple source of carbohydrates in the tropics, cassava is an essential part of the diet of about 600m. people. In 2021 it was harvested from an estimated 23.8m.&#160;ha in sub-Saharan Africa (cassava is barely grown in North Africa), and it may provide more than one-half of the calorific requirements of the vast population of the continent. The area in sub-Saharan Africa from which cassava was harvested in 2021 amounted to more than three-quarters (80%) of the area harvested worldwide in that year, and Africa’s output accounted for more than one-half (65%) of estimated world production. Most of the African crop is produced by subsistence farmers and is traded domestically: only a small quantity enters world trade, mainly dried or as cassava starch (South-East Asia, notably Thailand, dominates the export markets). The expansion of production from the mid-1980s was driven by demand for food consumption. Attempts undertaken in a number of African countries to increase the use of cassava as a feedstuff have met with only limited success, owing to cassava chips and pellets’ uncompetitiveness relative to imported feedstuffs. Little cassava production is exported.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.40">
      Pests and diseases can cause yield losses of up to one-half the cassava crop in Africa. From the early 1970s African production was seriously undermined by mealybug infestation. Indigenous to South America, the mealybug (
      <i>Phenacoccus manihoti</i>
      ) encountered few natural enemies in Africa, and by about 1992 had infested almost all African cassava growing areas. In 1981 the parasitic wasp 
      <i>Epidinocarsis lopezi</i>
       was introduced into Nigeria from Paraguay to attack the mealybug, and by 1990 it was successfully established in 25 African countries. The introduction of natural enemies, such as 
      <i>E. lopezi</i>
      , has brought about a 95% reduction in mealybug damage to cassava crops. The green spider mite (
      <i>Mononychellus tanajoa</i>
      ), another threat to cassava cultivation, has also been successfully combated by the introduction of a natural enemy, the phytoseiid mite (
      <i>Typhlodromalus aripo</i>
      ), which by 1997 had established a presence over 400,000 sq&#160;km in West Africa and in 1999 was reported to have reduced the presence of the green spider mite by up to 70% in some regions. Overall, there was reported to have been a 50% reduction in green spider mite damage to cassava crops owing to the introduction of natural predators. In the 2010s major threats include the variegated grasshopper, 
      <i>Zonocerus variegatus</i>
      , and African cassava leaf mosaic disease (CMD), which, like the green spider mite, deprives the plant of chlorophyll and causes low yields. CMD is carried by white-fly (
      <i>Bemisia tabaci</i>
      ), which also spreads the less prevalent but more serious cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) that has afflicted eastern Africa (Tanzania especially). At the start of the 2010s CMD and CBSD were together costing African farmers about US $1,000m. per year. Resistance to CMD has been developed, but control strategies for CBSD, which is highly infectious, mutates rapidly and difficult to detect, have thus far been far less effective. In 2015, as reported by FAO, the disease was described as one of the most important biotic threats to world food security, although by 2017 the use of genomic techniques had improved hopes of bringing CBSD under timely control. Pest and diseases, in combination with poor husbandry, have in the past led to substantial yield losses in African cassava crops. Other diseases include cassava bacterial blight, cassava anthracnose disease and root rot.

          <p id="ASS.MC.43">In the 21st century there has been interest in the utilization of cassava as an industrial raw material as well as a food crop. Cassava has the potential to become a basic energy source for ethyl alcohol (ethanol), a substitute for petroleum; `alcogas’ (a blend of cassava alcohol and petrol) can be mixed with petrol to provide motor fuel, while the high protein residue from its production can be used for animal feed. There is some anxiety, however, about the implications of such a development for food security. The possibility of utilizing cassava leaves and stems (which represent about 50% of the plant and are normally discarded) as cattle feed concentrates has also been receiving scientific attention.</p>
          <p>
               <b>Regional Research Institute</b>
       The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) is based in Ibadan, Nigeria. To combat losses from diseases and pests, in addition to the measures described above, IITA has conducted numerous projects, including programmes to develop (for resistance to pests and diseases) new (in some cases high yielding) varieties of cassava in Africa’s cassava belt. Notably, distribution of cassava varieties resistant to CMD brought under control the most recent outbreak of the disease which began in Uganda in the 1990s, and led to a recovery of cassava crops to pre-epidemic levels by the 2010s. The IITA operated regional hubs or stations in 35 African countries in mid-2023. The IITA has many international donors, and funding from and numerous links and partnerships with other organizations, networks and research establishments.

       In 2000 the average price of hard cassava pellets (f.o.b. Bangkok, Thailand) was US&#160;$55 per metric ton. Steady increases took this average to $111 per ton in 2005. Figures from the Thai Tapioca Trade Association have been used to calculate the average annual export price for tapioca (cassava) chips or hard pellets since 2010 (f.o.b. Koh Sichang, Thailand). Average monthly prices peaked in July 2015, then fell into the start of 2016 and again at the beginning of 2017, before recovering by the end of that year and into 2018. The price fluctuated but trended higher in 2019–22; by July 2023 the price had reached $265 per metric ton. Prices are also quoted for cassava starch (but are not given here).

          <!--Chromium appears only in ASS. We use the USGS for just about everything here. Text: the USGS Summary sheet for Chromium contains the info about reserves. GWJ 08/17-->
          <p id="ASS.MC.46">
      Chromium, historically used as an alloying element, is a hard, lustrous metal, the name of which derives from the Greek 
      <i>kroma</i>
       (colour). It is only obtained from chromite (the name applied both to the metal-bearing mineral and to the ore containing that mineral—the terms chromite ore, chromium ore and chrome ore are used interchangeably). About 91% of total demand for chromite is from the metallurgical industry, some 5% from the chemical industry and about 4% from the refractory and foundry industries. For the metallurgical industry, most chromite ore is smelted in an electric arc furnace to produce ferrochromium or ferrochrome, an alloy with iron. Within this industry the major use of chromium remains as an alloying element—it is essential to the composition of stainless steel, which is valued for its toughness and resistance to most forms of corrosion. Chromium chemicals are also used for wood preservation, dyeing and tanning. Chrome plating is a popular way of enhancing the appearance of motor vehicles, kitchen appliances, etc. Chromite is also used as a refractory mineral.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.47">The US Geological Survey (USGS) estimated world reserves to be at least 560m. metric tons of shipping-grade chromite ore in 2022, including Kazakhstan with 230m. tons, South Africa with 200m. tons, India with 100m. tons, Turkey (Türkiye from 2022) with 26m. tons, Finland with 8m. tons and the USA with 630,000 tons. What the USGS describes as the world’s resources of shipping-grade chromite ore (i.e. not only economic reserves) are reckoned to be greater than 12,000m. tons, 95% located in southern Africa and Kazakhstan. South Africa is the leading producer of chromite ore supplies and of ferrochromium. South African charge-grade, high-carbon ferrochromium (which has a chromium content of 52%–55%) has been replacing the more expensive high-&#160;and low-carbon ferrochromiums (which have a chromium content of 60%–70%) since the development, during 1965–75, of the argon-oxygen decarbonizing process.</p>

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       As with the ore, South Africa is one of the world’s dominant ferrochromium producers, accounting for an estimated 3.7m. tons, or 26% of world output, in 2021 (its highest output to date). In the same year Zimbabwe, the only other African producer, contributed 2% of estimated world ferrochromium production. South Africa’s ferrochromium sector has benefited historically from its access to inexpensive supplies of electrical energy, and from low labour costs, but in the 2000s the sector was beset by power supply problems. The impact of international boycotts and trade bans, and of civil disturbances, on South Africa’s ferrochrome industry in the 1980s led to the development of new production capacity, generally close to ore deposits, in Brazil, Finland, Greece, India, Sweden and Turkey (subsequently Türkiye). After 1993, however, the implementation of political change in South Africa acted to consolidate the country’s pre-eminence in international ferrochromium markets. While South Africa is the world’s leading producer of chromite ore, it is not its largest exporter (India, Kazakhstan and Türkiye have all exported more historically) since it processes much of its production. The world’s principal importer of chromite ore is the People’s Republic of China, which is also the largest producer of ferrochromium (an estimated 41% in 2021). From 2000 ferrochromium plants were increasingly developed in South Africa’s Bushveld Complex—more than 80% of the world’s chromite ore resources are located in southern Africa, associated with the Complex and the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe—while ferrochromium producers also sought to make greater use of chromite ore generated as a by-product of platinum mining. The value of exports of chromium ores and concentrates in 2022 amounted to some US&#160;$2,463m. (2.0% of the total value of exports in that year). South Africa exported 85% of ferrochromium production in 2014, as well as 27% of chromite ore production. Domestic consumption of chromium ore had been challenged by Chinese demand and problems with electricity for the ferrochromium industry. The inadequacy of transport infrastructure, as well as electricity supply, and concerns about the environmental impact of chromite ore mining have all confronted the industry in the 21st century. The largest chromite and ferrochromium producer in South Africa, and the world, is Glencore Xstrata, its joint venture partner in South Africa being the local Merafe Resources. Samancor Chrome is South Africa’s second chromite ore and ferrochromium producer.
    </p>
          <p>Zimbabwe’s ferrochromium industry was beset into the 2000s by problems arising from the currency exchange rate, by inadequate power supplies and by deficiencies in rail transportation. However, Zimbabwe is believed to have the world’s second largest reserves of chromium. In 2013 a number of local co-operatives and small-scale miners dominated ore extraction on the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe, but the largest single companies were Zimbabwe Mining and Smelting Co (Zimasco), with operations near Darwendale, Lalapanzi, Mutorashanga, Ngezi and south of Shurugwi, and, far smaller, Zimbabwe Alloys (Zim Alloys), with the Inyala mine. The Zimasco plant is the main ferrochromium producer; national output recovered from a level of some 72,000 metric tons in 2009, during a world recession, to some 146,000 tons in 2010, then fluctuating at that sort of level until a sharp increase to 214,110 tons in 2014. Output fell substantially in 2016, to just 78,200 tons, before regaining lost ground in 2018–19, reaching 311,500 tons in the latter year. Output fell in 2020, but recovered once again in 2021, to reach 306,847 tons. Six companies apart from Zimasco and Zim Alloys operate smelters in Zimbabwe.</p>
          <p>Sudan has been gradually increasing its relatively minor production of chromite ore, while Madagascar reopened its Bemanevika mine (with a remaining estimated production life of 15 years) in 2009, so that output soon recovered from the 60,000 metric tons low point of that year. In 2010 Nigeria found that its chromite deposits in the Anka area of Zamfara state were exploitable, and future production there was considered a possibility.</p>
          <!--Prices: pretty unsatisfactory, but chromium is not openly traded, so it is best to rely on the USGS Summary sheet (Salient Statistics for the US has a couple of indicator prices that we use). Please note, particularly for ferrochromium, prices in earlier years are often revised. The standing five-yearly ones are fine. GWJ 08/17-->

               <b>Prices</b>
       Chromite and ferrochrome prices tend to be negotiated on a private contract basis, although some publications produce indicator prices. The USGS provides a series of average annual import values that can provide an index for the movement of international prices: gross quantity of chromite ore (44% Cr

      O
      <sub>3</sub>
       f.o.b. South Africa) and the chromium content of ferrochromium (high-carbon, containing 49% to 51% chromium).

          <p id="ASS.MC.56">Cobalt is usually mined as a by-product of another metal; in the case of African cobalt, this is principally copper, although cobalt is also produced from nickel-copper-cobalt ores in Botswana and Zimbabwe and from platinum ores in South Africa. It is rarely mined as the primary product of an ore, and is found in very weak concentration, generally 0.1%–0.5%. The ore must be crushed and ground after mining, and subjected to a flotation process to obtain the concentrate. In the mid-1990s it was predicted that a new method of extraction, known as pressure acid leaching, would substantially increase the rate of recovery of cobalt as a by-product when laterite nickel ore is treated. In the first decades of the 2000s, however, this process was still not widely applied.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.57">Traditional cobalt mining may eventually be complemented, and perhaps superseded, by the wide-scale retrieval of manganese nodules from the world’s seabeds. It is estimated that the cobalt content of each nodule is about 0.25%, although nodules recovered from the Pacific Ocean in 1983 had a cobalt content of 2.5%. Ferromanganese crusts, containing extractable cobalt, have been identified at relatively shallow depths within the USA’s exclusive economic zones, which extend 370&#160;km (200 nautical miles) into US coastal waters. Some of the most valuable cobalt-bearing nodules were considered to be those in the Pacific Ocean around the Cook Islands, where estimates of the cobalt resource were placed as high as 32m. metric tons. Nodules off Namibia were thought to have a lesser, though still significant, cobalt content. However, the full exploitation of seabed resources such as these is thought likely to remain impracticable for many years to come.</p>

          <!--WMR text: reserves info comes from the USGS Summary sheet; the Cobalt Institute (CI, formerly the Cobalt Development Institute, CDI) sometimes updates stuff, but I cannot find the bit about largest companies (might be in USGS). There is a refined cobalt production table in USGS Yearbook, after the mined production one, and that is useful, along with USGS country surveys, if updated. A bit of googling will have to do otherwise. GWJ Aug 2017-->
          <p id="ASS.MC.58">
               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       The principal uses of cobalt are in the manufacture of rechargeable batteries and in superalloys (mainly for aircraft engines), but it is also used for hard and wear resistant materials, as a catalyst, in ceramics, enamels, pigments and colours (9%), and for magnets, among many other uses. The USA remains the world’s principal consumer of cobalt, especially in superalloys for the aerospace industry. In 2022 the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) possessed almost one-half of the world’s identified economic cobalt reserves (48%, according to estimates by the US Geological Survey—USGS). These reserves, associated with the country’s copper deposits, also have the highest grade of the metal, with up to six metric tons of cobalt produced with every 100 tons of copper. The DRC, therefore, is by far the largest producer and exporter of cobalt ore in the world, although its production of the refined metal is less significant. In 2020 the USGS estimated that the People’s Republic of China was the largest producer of refined cobalt in the world, followed by Finland, Canada, Norway and Japan. Given the sheer scale of resources in the DRC, the country is likely to remain fundamental to the international cobalt market.
    </p>
          <p>The mining, marketing and export of cobalt from the DRC was conducted by a state monopoly, La Générale des Carrières et des Mines (Gécamines), but from 2008 a large refinery of Katanga Mining was also in operation. Between 2010 and 2015 there were plans for several new projects, including two new mines, two new refineries, and enhanced capacity at several existing refining and processing facilities. Artisanal miners have been responsible for much of the DRC’s mined output of cobalt ore production since the 1990s, gathering by hand cobalt-rich ores containing the mineral heterogenite. Many of these ores have been exported, via intermediaries and illegally, in particular to India and the People’s Republic of China. Much of China’s cobalt refining industry is supplied with Congolese ore or, increasingly, semi-processed cobalt. In 2015 the USGS reported that only 5% of Congolese mine production was exported as refined cobalt, although it reported that refined cobalt production had increased by 140% in 2017. In 2021, according to official preliminary figures, cobalt exports accounted for 16% of the DRC’s total export revenues, whereas copper exports accounted for 68%. Despite the use by the Government of export bans to encourage refining, the industry remained constricted by the country’s chronic power shortage. In August 2019 Glencore (of Switzerland/UK) announced that it would be closing the Mutanda mine, which accounts for some 20% of global cobalt production, for a period of two years, citing its unprofitability. However, in mid-2021 Glencore announced that it was planning to reopen the mine, and in mid-2023 its staged restart resulted in output in excess of 10,000 tons for the year. </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.61">Since the early 1980s Zambia has promoted the expansion of its cobalt production in an attempt to offset declines in copper output, with varying degrees of success. Zambia remains a significant producer of refined cobalt, although according to the USGS, in 2015 production fell by almost 31%. Production recovered substantially in 2016, with output increasing by some 58%, but fell thereafter, reaching just 1,500 metric tons in 2019 (less than one-third its 2016 level). In 2020 it produced no refined cobalt. Exports of cobalt contributed 1.7% of Zambia’s total exports in 2016. In the following year export earnings from cobalt increased by 10.5%, notwithstanding a decline in actual export volumes during the year (owing to an increase in commodity prices.) In 2015 Zambia accounted for 4% of total exports of cobalt and copper. Elsewhere in Africa, cobalt was being produced as a by-product of other mining operations in South Africa. That country also produced some refined cobalt, as did Uganda. In 1992–2013 cobalt was extracted from stockpiles of cobaltiferous concentrate at the old Kilembe copper-cobalt mine in south-western Uganda (where operations had ceased in 1977). With the Kilembe stockpile about to be exhausted, in 2013 the Government secured a commitment to investment in reopening mining operations from Chinese company Tibet Hima, but the 25-year contract was cancelled in 2018 owing to alleged breaches of the concession agreement. In 2010, according to data cited by the USGS, Ugandan cobalt exports contributed 1.1% of total export revenue. Botswana tends to export its cobalt ore to Norway and Zimbabwe for refining. In 2011 a refinery project was abandoned, owing to escalating costs and interruptions to power supply in the area; only smelting takes place in the country. In 2016 Botswana’s smelter production declined by 11%, according to the USGS, and no cobalt ore production was reported in 2017–20. Neighbouring Zimbabwe also produces some cobalt ore. In Madagascar, the operator of the Ambatovy nickel laterite project is Canada’s Sherritt International. Construction of what is set to become one of the world’s biggest nickel laterite mines was slowed by escalating costs, but an operating licence was granted in September 2012 and commercial production began in 2014, with output eventually expected to reach 5,600 tons per year. With development costs of almost $7,000m., the mine represented the largest ever foreign investment in Madagascar. Nickel-cobalt deposits were first identified in north-western Tanzania in the early 1990s, and have since been the object of detailed exploration. Cobalt reserves, estimated initially at about 20,000 tons, remained unexploited there as of 2023 (construction of a mine at Kabanga is anticipated), as did reserves identified in Côte d’Ivoire.</p>

               <b>Prices</b>
       There have been different price references for cobalt, but a useful indicator was formed with the launch of a cobalt contract on the London Metal Exchange (LME) in 2010. Under the LME contract, cobalt was traded in lots consisting of four 250-kg drums (one metric ton) of minimum 99.3% cobalt, delivered by brand, with impurities identified, to warehouses in Baltimore (USA), Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Singapore. Trading was by `open outcry’ ring trading, as well as electronically and by telephone. The prices determined in the ring were intended to be used by the industry as a reference price. It remained unclear whether the market would adapt in the long term to this type of regulated pricing model for trading `spot’ and future contracts, but interest remained strong. The LME contracts began trading during 2010, so the first annual average indicator price cited by the USGS was for 2011 (US&#160;$16.01 per lb), the mean of the cash buyer price and cash seller and settlement price (minimum 99.3% cobalt briquettes, cathode, ingot, or rounds). The USGS also gives an average annual import price into the USA (`spot’ price for minimum 99.8% cobalt cathode, as reported by 
      <i>Platts Metals Week</i>
      , now 
      <i>Platts Metals Daily</i>
      ). Prices are given in US dollars per avoirdupois pound. In 2017 prices for cobalt more than doubled, the steep increases attributed to strong customer demand and limited supply on the spot market. The price continued to increase in 2018, but fell for a period in 2019 until news of Glencore’s temporary closure of the Mutanda mine was announced. The mid-2021 announcement that the mine would be reopened, civil unrest in South Africa (a major supply route for the DRC’s mined output), COVID-related restrictions on production in the DRC, and strong demand in the electric vehicle sector, all pushed prices higher in 2021. Prices remained high in 2022 as a consequence of the Russian Federation’s renewed armed invasion of Ukraine. However, prices fell in mid-2023 as supplies in Indonesia and Africa increased far in excess of global demand for electric vehicles.

          <!--Cocoa needs to be copied from ASS to FEA. We use FAO for Production and Trade, and later the more current ICCO stats. Table: use FAO for production. FAO Africa total is the same as sub-Saharan Africa because no cocoa is produced in Northern Africa, including Sudan. The World Market and Region (WMR) text: for the blurb on the cocoa industry and the main companies, keep an eye on the news. Thereafter we rely on ICCO figures, apart from FAO regional figures to start. On the Statistics dropdown in the ICCO website hover over Production and Grindings and two options appear, Production and Grindings, click on one and you will get to a page that has a column on the right and, under Statistical Data, you will see the options that can take you to the right place to download one then the other. Country specific data is from FAO Trade, which I could not update in 2017. Fairly self-explanatory though. You can update Ivory Coast grindings from ICCO. Ghana trade stats seemed to be behind so I googled for Ghana plus atlas.media.mit.edu. I did not update the Cameroon figure with the 2016 one from Europa because it distorted the thrust of the text, as a massive fall in 2016 petroleum exports needed more explanation than I could provide (nothing from a quick google), but if that is still the same next year (2018) rewrite this. International Associations: update membership from the ICCO and COPAL sites. Prices: use the Pink Sheet data. With International Cocoa Agreements, nothing to update, unless sufficient signatures bring the 2010 Agreement into force GWJ Aug 2017-->

      The cacao or cocoa tree, up to 14&#160;m tall, originated in the tropical forests of South America. The first known cocoa plantations were in southern Mexico around 
      <sc>ad</sc>
       600, although the crop may have been cultivated for some centuries earlier. Cocoa first came to Europe in the 16th century. The Spanish and Portuguese introduced cocoa into Africa—on the islands of Fernando Póo (now Bioko), in Equatorial Guinea, and São Tomé and Príncipe—at the beginning of the 19th century. At the end of the century the tree was established on the African mainland, first in Ghana and then in other West African countries. Cultivated cocoa trees may be broadly divided into three groups. Most cocoas belong to the Amazonian Forastero group, which now accounts for more than 80% of world cocoa production. It includes Amelonado varieties, suitable for chocolate manufacturing, and widely cultivated in Brazil and in West Africa. Criollo cocoa is rarely grown and is used only for luxury confectionery. The third group is Trinitario—descending from a cross between the Criollo and Forastero varieties, first grown in Trinidad (Trinidad and Tobago)—which comprises about 15% of world output and is cultivated mainly in Central America and the northern regions of South America.

          <p id="ASS.MC.71">Cocoa is now widely grown in the tropics, usually at altitudes less than 300&#160;m above sea-level, where it needs a fairly high rainfall and good soil. The cocoa tree has a much shallower tap root than, for example, the coffee bush, making cocoa more vulnerable to dry weather. Cocoa trees can take up to four years from planting before producing sufficient fruit for harvesting. They may live to 80 years or more, although the fully productive period is usually about 20 years. The tree is highly vulnerable to pests and diseases, and it is also very sensitive to climatic changes. Its fruit is a large pod, about 15–25 cm in length, which at maturity is yellow in some varieties and red in others. The ripe pods are cut from the tree, where they grow directly out of the trunk and branches. When opened, cocoa pods disclose a mass of seeds (beans) surrounded by white mucilage. After harvesting, the beans and mucilage are scooped out and fermented. Fermentation lasts several days, allowing the flavour to develop. The mature fermented beans, dull red in colour, are then dried, ready to be bagged as raw cocoa which may be further processed or exported. Much cocoa processing takes place in importing countries, notably the USA and the Netherlands. The processes include shelling, roasting and grinding the beans. The primary product of grinding is chocolate liquor, a part of which is sold directly to chocolate manufacturers; the remainder is then processed further, in order to extract a fat—cocoa butter—and chocolate powder. Almost half of each bean after shelling consists of cocoa butter. Cocoa powder for use as a beverage is largely fat free. Cocoa is a mildly stimulating drink, because of its caffeine content, and, unlike coffee and tea, is highly nutritious. The most important use of cocoa liquor is in the manufacture of chocolate, of which it is the main ingredient. About 90% of all cocoa liquor produced is used in chocolate making, for which extra cocoa butter is added, as well as other substances, such as sugar and, in the case of milk chocolate, milk. Cocoa butter is also used in cosmetic products, while the by-products of cocoa beans—the husks and shells—are used to make fertilizers and animal feed.</p>

          <p id="ASS.MC.72">
               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       In the 2000s mounting concerns about European Union (EU) and US moves to permit chocolate manufacturers to substitute vegetable fats for some of the cocoa solids and cocoa fats used in the manufacture of chocolate products were alleviated to an extent by consumer demand for high cocoa-content products (driven by perceived health benefits and the promotion of refined flavours) and the growing interest in organic produce. According to the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), such changes in consumption have mainly benefited the economies of those countries recognized by the International Cocoa Council (ICC) as exporters of premium cocoa (Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Grenada, Indonesia, Jamaica, Madagascar, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saint Lucia, São Tomé and Príncipe, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela). At the same time as this qualitative shift in consumption, which has expanded existing, saturated markets, increased consumption in emerging and newly industrialized countries, in particular in the Russian Federation and in Asia, has sustained demand for bulk cocoa. Another development has been the combination of growing consumer concerns about poverty in less developed countries with a more organized fair trade movement, which has established steady growth in sales of fair trade products since the early 1990s, mainly in Europe.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.73">The cocoa production chain is extremely labour-intensive: the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) estimated that in the 2000s some 3m. smallholders accounted for 90% of output worldwide. Large-scale plantations are found only in Brazil and Indonesia. The cocoa processing industry, meanwhile, is highly concentrated. In the 2000s the ICCO reckoned that the three major companies (Archer Daniels Midland—ADM and Cargill of the USA, and Barry Callebaut of Switzerland) processed about 40% of global cocoa production. Into the 2010s further consolidation took place. In July 2013 Barry Callebaut bought the cocoa unit of Petra Foods of Singapore, making the Swiss company the world’s largest cocoa processor (alone accounting for 25% of the global market). Later that year Cargill was reported to be negotiating to buy the cocoa and chocolate business of ADM, which would have created another giant to challenge Barry Callebaut and caused concern to competition authorities in Europe and the USA. In the event, ADM sold its chocolate interests to Cargill (the deal was cleared by the authorities in July 2015) and its cocoa business to Olam International Ltd (Singapore), another major cocoa trader along with Ecom Agroindustrial Corporation (Switzerland).</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.74">In 2021, according to FAO, the most important producing area in the world was Africa, which accounted for 68% of total output, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean, at 18%, and South-East Asia and Oceania, at 14%. In 2021 Africa accounted for 72% of foreign sales of cocoa beans worldwide, by volume, Latin America and the Caribbean 12% (the balance includes re-exports) and South-East Asia and Oceania 4%. According to estimated ICCO figures, the largest single producer of cocoa beans in 2021/22 (the cocoa year runs October–September) was Côte d’Ivoire, with 2.1m. metric tons, followed by Ghana with 0.7m. tons, Ecuador with 365,000 tons, Cameroon with 295,000 tons, Nigeria with 280,000 tons and Brazil with 220,000 tons; the largest Latin American producers, therefore, were Ecuador and Brazil. World output of cocoa beans was put at 4.82m. tons in 2021/22 (compared with 5.24m. tons in 2020/21), with output in 2022/23 forecast to reach 4.8m. tons; ICCO figures for production tend to be lower than those of the FAO. Only about two-fifths of the processing (grinding) of cocoa beans still takes place in the country of origin (although this was up to 47% in 2021/22, according to ICCO estimates), with Côte d’Ivoire accounting for 14% of the world total of 5.00m. tons, leaving the Netherlands with an estimated 12%, Indonesia and Germany with 9% each and the USA with 8%. Overall, Europe accounted for 36% of grindings, with Asia and Oceania just over 23%, Africa just under 23% and the Americas 19%. Global consumption of chocolate products is dominated by the European Union (EU—more than one-half) and by Northern America (one-quarter).</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.79">Cocoa is the most valuable agricultural export commodity in West Africa. Recorded world exports of cocoa beans, according to FAO, were 4.19m. metric tons in 2021, of which sub-Saharan African countries accounted for 72%. The world’s leading exporters of cocoa beans in 2021 were Côte d’Ivoire (1.7m. tons), Ghana (585,907 tons—some of the cocoa comes from other countries in the region), Nigeria (344,644 tons) and Ecuador, which is the world’s largest non-African producer-exporter, with 329,784 tons. Cameroon (250,817 tons) is also a significant exporter. In 2021 the next largest exporter in the world was the Netherlands (234,021 tons), followed by Belgium (214,625 tons). The Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda are usually the next most important African exporters, but other, non-African countries, such as Malaysia, Peru and the Dominican Republic, are more significant. In 2008 the number of cocoa farms in West Africa was estimated at 1.2m.–1.5m., with an average size of 3–5&#160;ha, employing 10.5m. workers in total. Côte d’Ivoire has been the leading producer in both regional and world terms since it overtook Ghana in 1977. Cocoa superseded coffee as Côte d’Ivoire’s main cash crop at the beginning of the 1980s. In 2022 30% of the country’s export revenue was derived from cocoa beans and cocoa preparations.</p>
          <p>Cocoa is traditionally Ghana’s most important cash crop, occupying more than one-half of all the country’s cultivated land. In the mid-1960s Ghana was the world’s leading producer, accounting for more than one-third of world production. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, however, Ghana’s cocoa production underwent a sharp decline. This contraction of the country’s cocoa industry has been attributed to growing competition from Côte d’Ivoire and to mismanagement. The decline was exacerbated by the smuggling of cocoa to neighbouring countries, where higher prices were obtainable. The spread of plant diseases, particularly black pod and swollen shoot, also inhibited recovery. Government attempts to liberalize the sector and to revive the industry began to have some effect in the early 2000s, assisted to some extent by political instability in Côte d’Ivoire. According to FAO, the country provided 14% of world exports in 2021. Although cocoa was overtaken in 1992 by gold as Ghana’s main export commodity, it regained its pre-eminence in 2003–06, only to be displaced again thereafter. In 2022, despite strong gold sales and some years of substantial petroleum exports, sales of cocoa beans and cocoa products still accounted for 14% of Ghana’s export revenue. Ghana has also invested considerably in processing facilities, as part of an attempt to add value to its exports. Between 2004/05 and 2013/14 Ghanaian grindings of cocoa beans almost tripled, from 80,000 tons to an estimated 234,000 tons; grindings were forecast at 300,000 tons in 2022/23, a 6% global share. Among the smaller African producers, cocoa exports are a significant component of the economies of Cameroon (where they contributed 10% of total export revenue in 2022) and of São Tomé and Príncipe (where they contributed 37% of total export revenue in 2022). Cocoa exports also remain important to, but by no means dominate, Togo’s foreign trade. Although cocoa is still the main export crop in Nigeria (which itself is Africa’s fourth largest producer), its significance to the economy has been eclipsed by petroleum, and the same can be said of Equatorial Guinea.</p>

               <b>International Associations</b>
       In accordance with the first International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA—see below), the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) was established in 1973. The ICCO was originally based in London, United Kingdom, but in April 2017 moved to Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire. Under the 2001 sixth ICCA, at October 2010 the membership of the Agreement, and hence of the Organization, comprised 44 countries (15 exporting members, 29 importing members), representing about 85% of world cocoa production and some 60% of world cocoa consumption. The European Union (EU) was also an intergovernmental party to the 2001 Agreement, but the USA, a leading importer of cocoa, was not a member, nor was Indonesia. Membership of the 2010 ICCA, however, included Indonesia (the third largest producer in the world) and Venezuela among the 21 exporting members by the end of January 2017; the 30 importing members included all 28 (at that time) EU members and Switzerland, as well as the Russian Federation (but not, still, the USA). The governing body of the ICCO is the International Cocoa Council (ICC), established to supervise implementation of the ICCA. The ICC is also based in Abidjan. The Cocoa Producers’ Alliance (COPAL), with headquarters in Lagos, Nigeria, had 10 members as of 2023: Brazil, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, the Dominican Republic, Gabon, Ghana, Malaysia, Nigeria, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Togo. The alliance was formed in 1962 with the aim of preventing excessive price fluctuations by regulating the supply of cocoa. Members of COPAL currently account for about three-quarters of world cocoa production. COPAL has acted in concert with successive ICCAs.

       The principal centres for cocoa trading in the industrialized countries are the London Cocoa Terminal Market, in the UK, and the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, in the USA. The ICCO daily price is based on the average of the first three positions on the terminal markets of New York and London (nearest three future trading months). Prices were at their highest in the late 1970s, even in nominal terms, when they reached an annual average of US&#160;$3.79 per kilogram ($3,790 per metric ton) in 1977 and $3.29 per kg in 1979. Prices only reached above $3.00 per kg again in the 2000s ($3.13 per kg in 2010). Average monthly prices fell as low as $2.02 per kg in February 2013, but recovered and fluctuated thereafter. The UK’s referendum vote in favour of leaving the EU in June 2016 had an impact on the London price, pushing daily prices up near their late 1970s levels for a time, but because of the severe decline in the value of the British currency—cocoa is one of the few commodities still denominated in the pound sterling—the dollar price fell. This price trend was exacerbated by a surplus in supply. The average monthly price rose throughout most of 2019 and into early 2020, peaking at $2.72 per kg ($2,716 per ton) in February (its highest level in almost three and a half years). Prices fluctuated in 2021–22, but had increased substantially by mid-2023, reaching $3.46 per kg ($3,460 per ton) in August, the highest level in more than a decade (largely owing to faltering supply in West Africa).

               <b>The International Cocoa Agreements</b>
       World prices for cocoa are highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand, making its market position volatile. Negotiations to secure international agreement on stabilizing the cocoa industry began in 1956. Full-scale cocoa conferences, under UN auspices, were held in 1963, 1966 and 1967, but all proved abortive. A major difficulty was the failure to agree on a fixed minimum price. In 1972 the fourth UN Cocoa Conference took place in Geneva, Switzerland, and resulted in the first International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA), adopted by 52 countries, although the USA, the world’s principal cocoa importer at that time, did not sign. The ICCA took formal effect in October 1973, bringing into existence the ICCO, based in London. Agreements followed in 1979, in 1981 (plus an extension) and in 1987, attempting to use quotas and a buffer stock to support the agreed prices. The buffer stock (which ceased to operate during 1983–88) and other financial operations under the fourth ICCA contributed to problems in the price stabilization mechanism. The fourth ICCA was extended for a two-year period from October 1990, although the suspension of the economic clauses rendered the agreement ineffective in terms of exerting any influence over cocoa market prices.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.84">A fifth ICCA was delayed by agreement to extend the fourth ICCA for a further year (until October 1993), because of disagreements about the export quota system and the dispos­ition of cocoa buffer stocks. In July 1993 terms were finally agreed for a new ICCA, to take effect from October, subject to its ratification by at least five exporting countries (accounting for at least 80% of total world exports) and by importing countries (representing at least 60% of total imports). Unlike previous commodity agreements sponsored by the UN, the fifth ICCA aimed to achieve stable prices by regulating supplies and promoting consumption, rather than through the operation of buffer stocks and export quotas. The new ICCA took effect in February 1994, to operate until 1998, although it was subsequently extended until September 2001. Stocks reduction and limitation were complemented by a number of other measures to achieve a closer balance of production and consumption. In April 2000 the ICCO agreed to implement measures to remedy low levels of world prices, centring on the elimination of sub-grade cocoa in world trade, which was perceived to be having a damaging effect on prices.</p>
          <p>A sixth ICCA was negotiated in February 2001. It aimed not only for stable prices through the regulation of supplies and the promotion of consumption, but for the development of a sustainable cocoa economy. The Agreement took provisional effect on 1 October 2003, for an initial five-year period; it was twice extended for two years, latterly from 1 October 2010. In November 2005, on its ratification by the Dominican Republic, the sixth ICCA entered definitively into force (the first time that this had happened). The Agreement was to remain open to new signatories until 2010, and was extended to when the next Agreement was due to enter into force. A seventh ICCA was signed in Geneva on the last day of the UN Cocoa Conference of 21–25 June 2010. It was opened for signature on 1 October for two years (subsequently extended to 2026). Previous agreements had been for five years, with extensions possible, but the 2010 Agreement was to be in effect for 10 years, provisionally from 1 October 2012, with the possibility of two four-year extensions, recognizing the perceived success of the existing regime.</p>

          <p id="ASS.MC.98">The coffee plant is an evergreen shrub or small tree, generally 5–10&#160;m in height, indigenous to Asia and tropical Africa. Wild trees grow to 10&#160;m, but cultivated shrubs are usually pruned to a maximum of 3&#160;m. The dried seeds (beans) are roasted, ground and brewed in hot water to provide one of the most popular of the world’s non-alcoholic beverages. Coffee is drunk in every country in the world, and its consumers comprise an estimated one-third of the world’s population. Although it has little nutrient value, coffee acts as a mild stimulant, owing to the presence of caffeine, an alkaloid also present in tea and cocoa.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.99">
      There are about 40 species of 
      <i>Coffea</i>
      , most of which grow wild in the eastern hemisphere. The two species of economic importance are 
      <i>C. arabica</i>
       (native to Ethiopia), which in the mid-2010s accounted for about 60% of world production, and 
      <i>C. canephora</i>
       (the source of Robusta coffee), which accounted for almost all of the remainder. Arabica coffee is more aromatic, but Robusta, as the name implies, is a stronger plant. Coffee grows in the tropical belt, between 20°N and 20°S, and from sea-level to as high as 2,000&#160;m above. The optimum growing conditions are found at 1,250–1,500&#160;m above sea-level, with an average temperature of around 17°C and an average annual rainfall of 1,000–1,750&#160;mm. Trees begin bearing fruit three to five years after planting, depending upon the variety, and give their maximum yield (up to 5&#160;kg of fruit per year) from the sixth to the 15th year. Few shrubs remain profitable beyond 30 years.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.100">Arabica coffee trees are grown mostly in the American tropics and supply the largest quantity and the best quality of coffee beans. The yield of Arabica trees has a propensity to follow a biennial cycle, whereby a heavy crop alternates with a light crop. In Africa and Asia Arabica coffee is vulnerable in lowland areas to a serious leaf disease, and consequently cultivation has been concentrated in highland areas. Some highland Arabicas, such as those grown in Kenya, are renowned for their high quality. The Robusta coffee tree, grown mainly in East and West Africa, and in the Far East, has larger leaves than Arabica, but the beans are generally smaller and of lower quality and, consequently, fetch a lower price. However, Robusta coffee has a higher yield than Arabica, as the trees are more resistant to disease. It can also be grown at lower elevations than Arabica, from 500&#160;m to 1,500&#160;m above sea level. Robusta varieties are popular among multinational roasters and soluble (`instant’) coffee producers.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.102">Each coffee berry, green at first but red when ripe, usually contains two beans (white in Arabica, light brown in Robusta) which are the commercial product of the plant. To produce the best quality Arabica beans—known in the trade as `mild’ coffee—the berries are opened by a pulping machine and the beans fermented briefly in water before being dried and hulled into green coffee. Much of the crop is exported in green form. Robusta beans are generally prepared by dry-hulling. Roasting and grinding are usually undertaken in the importing countries, for economic reasons, and because roasted beans rapidly lose their freshness when exposed to air. Apart from beans, coffee produces a few minor by-products. When the coffee beans have been removed from the fruit, what remains is a wet mass of pulp and, at a later stage, the dry material of the `hull’ or fibrous sleeve that protects the beans. Coffee pulp is used as cattle feed; the fermented pulp makes a good fertilizer; and coffee bean oil is an ingredient in soaps, paints and polishes.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.104">More than one-half of the world’s coffee is produced on smallholdings of less than 5&#160;ha. In most producing countries, and especially in Africa, coffee is almost entirely an export crop, with little domestic consumption (with the exception of Ethiopia). Green coffee accounts for about 80% of all the coffee that is exported, with coffee extract for flavouring, and soluble and roasted coffee comprising the balance. Tariffs on green/raw coffee are usually low or non-existent, but those applied to soluble coffee may be as high as 30%. The USA is the largest single coffee importer, according to the US Department of Agriculture—USDA), although its volume of coffee purchases was overtaken in 1975 by the combined imports of the (then) nine countries of the European Community (EC, now the European Union—EU). As an indicator, in the first four months of the 2020/21 crop year the USA accounted for 22% of world coffee imports, with the EU on 60%. Sub-Saharan Africa has no significant import­ers.</p>

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       After petroleum, coffee is the major raw material of world trade, and it is the single most valuable agricultural export of the tropics. In the 2010s about 26m. small producers worldwide depended on coffee. Coffee is the most important cash crop of Latin America, with a number of countries heavily dependent on it as a source of foreign exchange. Of the estimated total world crop of coffee beans in 2020/21, Latin American and Caribbean countries accounted for 61% (Brazil alone contributed 39% of the world total). Africa, which formerly ranked second, was overtaken in 1992/93 by Asian producers; in 2020/21 African producers accounted for 11% of the estimated world coffee crop, compared with 25% for countries in eastern Asia and Oceania—Far East and Australasia. India harvested a further 3% of the world coffee crop in the same year; the only other producer in South Asia was Sri Lanka, not a member of the International Coffee Organization—ICO. (The above shares have been calculated on the basis of data released by the ICO for production of `all exporting countries’. Non-members of the ICO accounted for 6% of the world coffee crop in 2013/14, but were not subsequently cited separately.) The 2014/15 harvest was lower than it would otherwise have been, because of continuing problems with coffee rust disease in Brazil and other countries, but higher output in Asia and Africa in 2015/16 and recovery in Brazil from 2016/17 pushed world harvests up gradually through 2020/21. Reports in 2021 indicated, however, that severe droughts had significantly hindered Brazilian production, placing upward pressure on global prices (see below).
    </p>
          <p>Robusta coffee beans, which are more suitable for the production of `instant’ coffee or coffee for flavouring, etc., are favoured by multinational roasters and `instant’ coffee producers because of the lower cost and less volatile price. Soluble (`instant’) coffee accounted for about 12.5% of all coffee exports in 2000–11. In the mid-2000s four main roaster companies (Kraft Foods, Nestlé, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Sarah Lee) purchased more than 50% of global Robusta coffee production. Some predicted a shift towards more mass Arabica purchases from 2014 by the large roasting companies. According to ICO estimates, in 2020/21 Robusta accounted for 36% of coffee on the international market.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.108">Africa’s largest exporter, and the fifth largest in the world in 2020/21, was Uganda (4.5% of global exports), followed by Ethiopia (2.2%). In the 20th century Côte d’Ivoire was long Africa’s leading coffee producer, and coffee was the country’s leading cash crop until 1980, when cocoa supplanted it—in 2022 exports of coffee accounted for just 0.5% of the country’s total export revenue. Despite a programme of replanting in the 1990s, more than 60% of Côte d’Ivoire’s coffee trees were reported in 2005 to be over 30 years old, and the country also suffered from political and military disruption, which affected the maintenance of coffee plantations. Production reached a nadir in 2010, and exports in 2011, but recovery began thereafter, and the country was the continent’s fourth largest exporter in 2020/21. Ethiopia is the continent’s largest producer and had consistently high exports in the 2000s and into the 2010s, despite significant domestic consumption. The country also emerged as the major regional producer of Arabicas. The contribution of coffee to total export earnings had declined into the 2000s, representing only about 39% in 2002 and falling to 23% by 2009. Coffee sales recovered somewhat in recent years, representing 49% of the value of total exports in 2022.</p>
          <p>The African countries that have traditionally been most dependent on coffee as a source of foreign exchange are Burundi and Uganda. In 2002 coffee sales accounted for three-quarters of Burundi’s total export revenue, although this was just 22% by 2022. The proportion varied considerably, depending on international coffee prices. In Uganda coffee provided about 27% of export earnings in 2022. The country was traditionally Africa’s leading exporter of coffee, but only the continent’s second largest producer. The coffee sector in Rwanda, which contributed more than 60% of export revenue in 1991, was severely affected by civil war, and in 1994 the bulk of the crop was lost. Rwanda’s coffee output—which consists mainly of Arabicas—began to recover only in the early 2000s. Despite contributing about 56% of Rwanda’s total export earnings in 1999, coffee was overtaken by tea as the major cash crop in 2000. Depending on the relative international prices, as well as production, coffee and tea were each in some years the leading agricultural export; in 2022 coffee exports accounted for 31% of total exports, four times more than tea in that year (making it the country’s most important cash crop).</p>
          <p>Among other African countries where coffee is an important export are Tanzania, Kenya, Cameroon, Togo, Ghana and the Central African Republic. Madagascar is not a significant exporter, but it is (along with Rwanda) Africa’s sixth largest producer; like Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar is not a member of the ICO. Angola was formerly the world’s leading exporter of Robusta coffee, but production during 1975–95 was severely disrupted by civil conflict. The full rehabilitation of Angola’s coffee industry depended on an enduring political and military settlement, and even then was expected to span many years.</p>

               <b>International Associations</b>
       The International Coffee Organization (ICO) was established in London, UK, in 1963 under the first International Coffee Agreement (see below). At November 2022, the ICO consisted of 42 exporting members (Venezuela acceded in October 2017) and seven importing members (33 importing nations in all, because one member was the 27-country EU); a further three countries had signed the seventh ICA but had not yet completed all membership procedures, while four more countries had not signed. In February 2017 Turkey (Türkiye from 2022) withdrew from the ICO, while the USA left in June 2018 and Paraguay in November 2019. In addition, there was an Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), also based in London, but it closed in 2002, and there is still an Inter-African Coffee Organization (IACO), based in Côte d’Ivoire (see below).

               <b>Prices</b>
       Coffee is traded on a number of exchanges worldwide. The ICO has two main indicator prices, one for Arabica beans (other mild Arabicas, average New York and Bremen/Hamburg markets, ex-dock) and the other for Robusta beans (Robustas, average New York and Le Havre/Marseilles markets, ex-dock). In the 2010s coffee again approached price levels similar to those experienced in the late 1970s, but only at current prices. Moreover, that is mainly true of the Arabica price, because the differential from the Robusta price has become more pronounced, although the indicators to some extent echo each other’s movement on a price graph: the all-time coffee price peak was in April 1977, the average monthly price for Arabicas reaching US&#160;$7.00 per kg (the Robusta price peaked at $6.88); the 2011 peak for Arabicas was $6.62 per kg in April (but for Robustas, $2.69 per kg in May); and the 2014 peak was $4.97 per kg in October (for Robustas, $2.33 per kg in April). Prices tended downwards from 2014, the Arabica price reaching an average monthly price of $3.20 per kg in January 2016 (the price had been lower in January 2014 and the months before), and the Robusta price $1.63 per kg in February 2016 (a level not seen since May 2010). The Arabica recovery peaked at $4.06 per kg in November but oversupply placed downward pressure on prices in 2017–19. Prices had recovered somewhat by late 2019, and grew throughout 2020–21. There was continued strong growth in the first half of 2022 on the back of historically high fuel prices (largely a result of sanctions and supply concerns following the Russian Federation’s renewed armed invasion of Ukraine) impacting transportation costs. By February the average price of Arabicas had reached its highest level in more than a decade. However, the price began to weaken from late 2022; by August 2023 it had fallen back to average $4.12 per kg. The average price of Robustas, meanwhile, grew over the same period, reaching its highest level in almost 30 years in June ($2.91 per kg); by August the price had declined to $2.75 per kg. The spike in the Robusta price was attributed to increased demand and supply constraints, especially in Indonesia and Viet Nam.

               <b>The International Coffee Agreements</b>
       Effective international attempts to stabilize coffee prices began in 1954, when a number of producing countries made a short-term agreement to fix export quotas. After three such agreements, a five-year International Coffee Agreement (ICA), covering both producers and consumers and introducing a quota system, was signed in 1962. This led to the establishment in 1963 of the ICO. Successive ICAs took effect in 1968, 1976, and 1983. The system of export quotas to stabilize prices was eventually abandoned in July 1989, contributing to a crisis in coffee prices as oversupply undermined market stability. In October 1993 the USA withdrew from the ICO (it did not rejoin it until 2005), which was increasingly perceived at that time to have been eclipsed by the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC—see below). In 1994 the ICO agreed provisions for a new five-year ICA (later extended), again with primarily consultative and administrative functions, and a successor ICA took effect provisionally in October 2001, and definitively in May 2005. By May 2007 the new ICA had been endorsed by 74 of the 77 members (45 exporting countries, 32 importing countries) of the International Coffee Council (ICC), the highest authority of the ICO. A seventh ICA, agreed between the 77 members of the ICC, was formally adopted in September 2007. The new agreement reiterated the objectives contained in the sixth ICA, emphasizing the need to support the advancement of a sustainable coffee economy to benefit small-scale farmers. It established in particular a Consultative Forum of Coffee Sector Finance that was to facilitate access to financial and market information in the coffee sector, and a Promotion and Market Development Committee that was to co-ordinate information campaigns, research and studies.

          <p id="ASS.MC.112">The ICAs are concerned with maintaining a stable price environment for the worldwide coffee market, but numerous and various disagreements led to the collapse of the quota system and of the extant ICA’s economic provisions. The failure to agree on a new formulation for quotas and the existence of high stock levels combined to keep coffee prices at historic `lows’ in the early 1990s. In September 1993 the Latin American producers announced the formation of an ACPC to implement an export withholding, or coffee retention, plan. In the following month the 25-member Inter-African Coffee Organization (IACO) agreed to join the Latin American producers in a new plan to withhold 20% of output whenever market prices fell below an agreed level. With the participation of Asian producers, a 28-member ACPC, with headquarters also in London, was formally established in August (its signatory member countries numbered 28 in 2001, 14 of which had ratified). Production by the 14 ratified members in 1999/2000 accounted for 61.4% of coffee output worldwide. In the meantime the ACPC coffee retention plan had come into operation in October 1993 and gradually generated improved prices. Ultimately, however, the ACPC was unable—even with the support of non-members—to bring about lasting price stability by pursuing coffee/export-retention strategy. In October 2001 the ACPC announced that it would dissolve itself in January 2002, its relevance compromised by breaches of the retention plan and poor finances. Meanwhile, in May 2001 the collapse in the price of coffee had been described as the most serious crisis in a global commodity market since the 1930s, with prices at their lowest level ever in real terms. The collapse of the market was regarded, fundamentally, as the result of an ongoing increase in world production at twice the rate of growth in consumption, this oversupply having led to an overwhelming accumulation of stocks. (In this connection, some observers highlighted the role of Viet Nam, which had substantially increased its production and exports of coffee in recent years: by mid-2000 Viet Nam had overtaken Indonesia to become the world’s leading supplier of Robusta coffee and was rivalling Colombia as the second largest coffee producing country overall.) In early July 2001 the price of the Robusta coffee contract for September delivery fell below US&#160;$540 per metric ton, marking a record 30-year `low’. At about the same time the ICO recorded its lowest composite price ever. Despite a recovery beginning in October, the average composite price recorded by the ICO for 2001 was 29% lower than the average composite price recorded in 2000. In 2001 coffee prices were at their lowest level since 1973 in nominal terms, and at a record low level in real terms. Although prices began to recover slowly, the low returns for producers in the early 2000s created what was sometimes called the `coffee crisis’. In its review of the 2004/05 crop year, the ICO noted that the crisis in the coffee economy of exporting countries had abated somewhat, although oversupply of Robustas and augmented demand for Arabicas increased the differential between the two prices. Against this background, the seventh ICA sought to protect not only markets, but farmers, in future.</p>

Table: we can update from the Copper Summary from the USGS, although there is a footnote about the regional total if so (plus an odd little figure to work out, giving a total if worked out as the same proportion as the last year for which a full regional total is available - i.e. in the Yearbook). In 2017 the USGS had not updated the Copper Yearbook so we had to use the Summary for the two most recent years. The World Market and Region (WMR) text: information from the International Copper Study Group website can be obtained from the World Copper Factbook, but this is not the latest information if freely available. However, follow Statistics and Selected Data (unless they redesign the website!) to find the latest figures for usage, production, etc. Generally, for country specific stuff use the USGS country Yearbook chapters, but they had not been updated in 2017. Also Europa trade stats tables on occasion. And the news. Global Forum: update from the ICSG website. Prices: use the Pink Sheet data. GWJ 08/17-->
          <p id="ASS.MC.135">Copper is a reddish-orange metal (copper compounds, by contrast, often give a blue or green colour to minerals) in use even before the `Bronze Age’, the characteristic metal of which was obtained by the addition of tin to copper. The ores containing copper are mainly copper sulphide or copper oxide. They are mined both underground and by open-cast or surface mining. After break-up of the ore body by explosives, the lumps of ore are crushed, ground and mixed with reagents and water, in the case of sulphide ores, and then subjected to a flotation process by which copper-rich minerals are extracted. The resulting concentrate, which contains about 30% copper, is then dried, smelted and cast into anode copper, which is further refined to about 99.98% purity by electrolysis (chemical decomposition by electrical action). The cathodes are then cast into convenient shapes for working or are sold as such. Oxide ores, less important than sulphides, are treated in ways rather similar to the solvent extraction process described below.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.136">Two alternative copper extraction processes were developed in the 20th century. The first of these techniques, and of little importance in the industry, is known as the `Torco’ (treatment of refractory copper ores) segregation process, which can be used for extracting copper from silicate ores that were previously not treatable. A commercial plant was operated in Zambia from the 1960s, until 1983, and another in Mauritania in the 1970s. The second, and relatively low-cost, technique is the solvent extraction process. This is suited to the treatment of very low-grade oxidized ores and is used on both new ores and waste dumps that have accumulated over previous years from conventional copper working. The copper in the ore or waste material is dissolved in acid, and the copper-bearing leach solution is then mixed with a special organic-containing chemical reagent which selectively extracts the copper. After allowing the two layers to separate, the layer containing the copper is separated from the acid leach solution. The copper is extracted from the concentrated leach solution by means of electrolysis to produce refined cathodes.</p>

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       Copper is ductile, resists corrosion, and is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. Its industrial uses are mainly in the electrical industry (about 60% of copper is made into wire for use in power cables, telecommunications, domestic and industrial wiring) and the building, engineering and chemical industries. Bronzes and brasses are typical copper alloys used for both industrial and decorative purposes. There are, however, substitutes for copper in almost all of its industrial uses, and in recent years aluminium has presented a challenge in the electrical and transport industries. The major copper importing countries are the People’s Republic of China, the member states of the European Union (EU), Japan and the USA. According to the International Copper Study Group (ICSG), worldwide usage of refined copper reached a new record in 2022 of 26.1m. metric tons (provisional figure), with usage slightly up (4.3%) in the first five months of 2023 compared with the previous year. In 2022 Asia accounted for 74% of refined usage and Europe 15%. The largest copper mining companies in the world are CODELCO (Chile), Freeport-McMoRan (USA), Glencore (Switzerland/UK) and BHP Billiton (Australia/UK).
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.139">Proven world reserves of copper were estimated by the USGS at 890m. metric tons (copper content) in 2022. In that year about 2.1% of the world’s total reserves were located in Zambia, where copper production is the mainstay of the economy, and copper sales at one time accounted for some 85% of export earnings. Production of refined copper in Zambia had entered a gradual decline in the mid-1980s; dwindling ore grades, high extraction costs, transport problems, shortages of foreign exchange, equipment and skilled labour, lack of maintenance and labour unrest combined to make the copper industry seem an unstable basis for the Zambian economy. However, following a change of government in 1991, a number of remedial measures were implemented. Before being overtaken by Canada in 1983, Zambia ranked second only to Chile among the world’s copper exporters, but it fell also behind Peru in 2010. Zambian copper exports are predominantly in refined but unwrought form (Zambian smelter production totalled a preliminary 750,600 metric tons in 2020, refinery production a preliminary 378,400 tons). Copper and articles thereof provided 70% of Zambia’s export income in 2022.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.141">Even before the Zairean (Congolese) civil conflict, which began in 1993 and was renewed in 1998, led to the suspension of much of the country’s normal mining activity, the copper industry in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) had become increasingly vulnerable to competition from other producers, such as Chile, which have established new open-cast, low-cost mines. The DRC had placed greater emphasis on efforts to increase refined production capacity, but war had an impact on facilities and infrastructure. In 2022 copper ores and concentrates accounted for 9% of total exports of US&#160;$29,518m. (although exports of copper and articles thereof—principally refined copper—contributed 57% of the value of total exports). South Africa is the continent’s other main producer, although from the 1980s copper output was affected by declining grades of ore, leading to mine closures and a reduction in the level of operations. The country had a number of smelters (producing a preliminary 13,000 metric tons in 2020) and refineries (an estimated 21,800 tons). South African exports of copper ores and concentrates earned $187m. in 2022 (copper and articles thereof earned $1,026m.). Namibia derived more than 10% of its total export revenue from copper in the late 1980s, but recorded a fluctuating performance into the 2000s, with global economic conditions and mine flooding in 2008 closing much of the industry until 2011 (when only 3,370 tons were produced, with a preliminary 15,741 tons by 2020). Smelter production depended on imported concentrates for some years. In Botswana copper and nickel are mined at Selebi-Phikwe, and high-grade copper ore deposits have also been identified in the Ghanzi area. The country mined some 38,000 tons in 2014, almost double the 2011 output, but by 2020 output had fallen to just 1,462 tons—largely a result of its smelter closing down in 2016 (and in 2019–20 production was negligible. In 2018 exports of copper-nickel matte contributed only about 3% of Botswana’s total export revenue—but this fell to almost negligible amounts in 2017–22. In 2006, in response, partly, to the high price of copper on international markets, Wambao Shinex of China (51%) and Zimbabwe Mining Development Corpn (49%) formed Zimbao Mining Ventures, in order to assess the potential for reopening Zimbabwe’s Mhangura and Sanyati copper mines and the country’s smelter and refining complex at Lomangundi. Copper mining and refined copper production recovered more emphatically in the 2010s (mined output was a preliminary 7,933 tons of copper concentrates in 2020). From 2007 Mauritania was producing a significant amount of copper in concentrates from the Guelb Moghrein mine, 250&#160;km north-east of Nouakchott; output in 2020 was a preliminary 28,491 tons. In 2020 Tanzanian production of copper concentrates and bullion (doré) stood at an estimated 10,000 tons.</p>

               <b>International Association</b>
       The ICSG, initially comprising 18 producing and importing countries, was formed in 1992 to compile and publish statistical information and to provide an intergovernmental forum on copper. In 2023 ICSG members and observers totalled 24 countries, plus the EU, accounting for more than 80% of world trade in copper. The ICSG, which is based in Lisbon, Portugal, does not participate in trade or exercise any form of intervention in the market.

       There is no international agreement between producers and consumers governing the stabilization of supplies and prices. Although most of the world’s supply of primary and secondary copper is traded direct between producers and consumers, prices quoted on the London Metal Exchange (LME), the New York Commodity Exchange (COMEX) and the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) provide the principal price setting mechanism for world copper trading. The World Bank cites the average settlement price of Grade `A’ copper (minimum purity 99.9935%) traded on the LME.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.157">Along with other commodities, copper experienced exceptionally high prices into the beginning of 2008, until economic recession occasioned by the global financial crisis of that year set in. In real terms at least, the price did not exceed the record levels of early 1974, which had collapsed with the onset of the oil crisis of that year. In nominal terms, the average annual copper price in 1974 was only US&#160;$2,058.5 per metric ton (monthly averages peaked in April at $3,031.8 per ton), and compared with, in 2008, $6,955.8 per ton (peaking in April at $8,684.93 per ton). Copper recovered to a new nominal record in 2011, the monthly average peaking at an all-time high, at current prices, of $9,867.6 per ton in February, with the highest daily price reaching over $10,100 per ton. Prices trended downwards thereafter, albeit with some short-lived recoveries, reaching the lowest monthly price in almost seven years in January 2016; prices were up and down in 2016–19 and into early 2020, reaching just $5,058.0 in April of the latter year. However, from mid-2020 prices began to increase substantially, reaching $10,231 per ton by March 2022, the highest monthly average on record. High prices were attributed to falling inventories and higher demand as many countries emerged from economic restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Prices were generally lower (although still high, historically) in the second half of 2022 and into 2023. The price had fallen to average $8,349 per ton by August 2023.</p>

Table: updating the USDA table, you will need the latest Cotton WMPTR (World Market, Production, and Trade Report) and PSD Online. But it is a bit fiddly. The WMPTR has a Cotton World Supply, Use, and Trade table in 1000 MT (000 metric tons - Table 01) and this can be used to update the world total and the main producers. Check the August edition of the Cotton WMPTR (just before you send) as a few figures might have changed, but it will at least date from after the end of the crop year cited (from 1 August). Still on the Table, for regional total and any African producers (none is caught in the WMPTR summary table), you will need PSD Online. Bring up every country and scan for large ones not caught by the WMPTR (you have probably copied much of this from SAsia, so just look at African countries), then Return to Query and just select the countries you want, including all the minor ones from Africa (so you can update the figures in the text, as they are not caught by our production table). Later, you can also Return to Query and include Exports and Imports as well as Production. Fiddly bit: The PSD Online figures are in 1000 bales so, for the ones not already covered, to get metric tons you have to multiply by 217.728 (NB. that is an exact metric tons figure, but do not forget that the table is in 000 tons). Do the most recent year then check previous year and, if a change, check the year before too, etc. WMR text: consumption, import and export figures all update from the WMPTR.

          <p id="ASS.MC.159">
      Cotton is the name given to the soft hairs that grow on the epidermis of the seed of the plant genus 
      <i>Gossypium</i>
      . The most important of the four species cultivated for fibre is 
      <i>G. hirsutum</i>
      , upland cotton, which originated in Mexico and now accounts for about 90% of the cotton harvest. 
      <i>G. barbadense</i>
       is the extra long staple cotton, originating in Peru and accounting for a further 5%–8%; it is generally known by a number of names, such as Pima, American or Creole cotton and, with a reputation for quality, Egyptian and Sea Island cotton. The two Old World commercial species are 
      <i>G. arboreum</i>
      , the tree cotton of South Asia, and 
      <i>G. herbaceum</i>
       or Levant cotton.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.160">The initial development of the cotton fibres takes place within a closed pod, called a boll, which, after a period of growth of about 50–75 days (depending upon climatic conditions), opens to reveal white tufts of cotton hair. After the seed cotton has been picked, the cotton fibre, or lint, has to be separated from the seeds by means of a mechanical process, known as ginning. (Cotton has been cultivated since antiquity, but the invention of the cotton gin revolutionized production costs and led to it becoming the natural fibre most widely used in clothing.) Depending upon the variety and growing conditions, it takes about three metric tons of seed cotton to produce one ton of raw cotton fibre. After ginning, a fuzz of very short cotton hairs remains on the seed. These are called linters, and may be removed and used in the manufacture of paper, cellulose-based chemicals, explosives, etc. The remaining cottonseed can have an oil extracted, the residual meal or cake being used for animal feed, etc.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.161">About one-half of the cotton produced in the world is used in the manufacture of clothing, about one-third is used for household textiles and the remainder is used for numerous industrial products (tarpaulins, rubber reinforcement, abrasive backings, filters, high-quality papers, etc.). The official cotton `season’ (for trade purposes) runs from 1 August to 31 July of the following year, and quantities are measured in both metric tons and bales; for statistical purposes, one bale of cotton is 226.8 kg (500 lb) gross or 217.7 kg (480 lb) net. The price of a particular type of cotton depends upon its availability relative to demand and upon characteristics related to yarn quality and suitability for processing. These include fibre length, fineness, cleanliness, strength and colour. The most important of these is length. Generally, the length of the fibre determines the quality of the yarn produced from it, with the longer fibres being preferred for the finer, stronger and more expensive yarns.</p>

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       Cotton is the world’s leading textile fibre. However, with the increased use of synthetics, cotton’s share in the world’s total consumption of fibre declined from 48% in 1988 to about 31% in 2012. About one-third of the decline in its market share was attributed to increases in the real cost of cotton relative to prices of competing fibres, and the remaining two-thirds to other factors, for example greater use of chemical fibre filament yarn (yarn that is not spun but is extruded in a continuous string) in domestic textiles, such as carpeting. In the 21st century, two important factors in the international trade in cotton have been output in the USA, which is among the world’s leading producers without the matching levels of consumption, and the Chinese market (although officially enforced limits on the use of cotton in the People’s Republic of China had ramifications for the international market). According to data compiled by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), consumption of cotton worldwide had reached a record peak of 27.0m. metric tons in 2006/07, only for the greatest contraction in cotton consumption since the Second World War (by some 11%) to be precipitated after the world financial crisis in 2008 triggered a crash in commodity prices and a global economic recession. Consumption recovered to 26.2m. tons in 2018/19, but had fallen again to 23.8m. tons by 2022/23. The largest cotton consumers are China (33% of the world total in 2022/23) and India (21%); Pakistan, Bangladesh, Türkiye (Turkey before 2022) and Viet Nam are among other important consumers. China was for a time overwhelmingly the largest importer of cotton, but in 2015/16–2017/18 was displaced by both Bangladesh and Viet Nam. China and Bangladesh took turns as the largest importer of cotton in 2019/20–2022/23; in the latter year Bangladesh bought 18% of global imports. Viet Nam purchased 17% in that year, followed by China (also 17%—down from 54% in 2011/12), Pakistan, Türkiye, India and Indonesia. The world’s principal exporters of cotton are the USA (34% in 2022/23), Australia (18%), Brazil (17%), Greece and India (3% each), and Benin (almost 3%); Uzbekistan is also traditionally an important exporter, as are Burkina Faso and Mali.

          <p id="ASS.MC.171">Cotton is a major source of income and employment for many developing countries, both as a primary product and, increasingly, through sales of yarn, fabrics and finished goods. The countries of francophone West Africa are, generally, significant exporters of cotton. Cotton is usually the principal commercial crop, in terms of foreign exchange earnings, in Benin, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chad, Mali, Mozambique, Sudan and Togo. It is also important in Senegal (although less than in the 20th century) and in Tanzania, in East Africa. In the early 2000s more than 90% of cotton entering the world market from sub-Saharan Africa came from the francophone countries of the CFA franc zone. The largest producer and exporter of cotton in sub-Saharan African—indeed, in the whole continent from 2008/09, owing to poor harvests in Egypt—is usually Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso was the 14th largest producer in the world in 2022/23; it exported 163,296 tons in that same production year, making it Africa’s second largest (with Mali) and the world’s eighth largest exporter. In 2022/23 Burkina Faso’s exports were surpassed by those of Benin (217,728 tons). Cameroon, Sudan and Côte d’Ivoire also exported significant volumes. In addition, Togo, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi and Nigeria were notable exporting producers. Ethiopia has an important cotton harvest but mainly for its domestic market, having exported little since 2014. For many years in the 20th century Sudan was the largest cotton producer in sub-Saharan Africa. However, from the 1970s the industry was adversely affected by domestic difficulties resulting from climatic factors, an inflexible, government dictated marketing policy and crop infestation by white­fly. The area under cotton cultivation in Sudan had declined dramatically by the late 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s that improved levels of output seemed likely to be sustained; indeed, Sudan increased its output more than fourfold between 2014/15 and 2020/21, for example. In 2022/23 Sudan was the region’s fifth largest producer.</p>

               <b>Prices</b>
       Although co-operation in cotton affairs has a long history, there have been no international agreements governing the cotton trade. Proposals to link producers and consumers in price stabilization arrangements have been opposed by the USA (the world’s largest cotton exporter), and by Japan and the European Union (EU). Liverpool, United Kingdom, is the historic centre of cotton-trading activity, and international cotton prices are still collected by organizations located there. However, almost no US cotton has been imported through Liverpool in the 2000s, and consumption in the textile industry in the United Kingdom has fallen to negligible levels. The Cotton Outlook (Cotlook) `A’ index has long since changed from Liverpool quotations, then in August 2004 from c.i.f. Northern Europe to C/F Far East. The cotton quality base for the index is middling upland cotton, 1–3/32 inch. A decline in world cotton stocks in 2010 limited supplies, not only maintaining prices at high levels, but creating problems for indexing. From 22 June the usual Cotlook `A’ index was suspended, owing to a lack of quotations on offers, and the new `A’ forward index was then relied on. The World Bank cites the Cotlook `A’ figures, which recorded average monthly prices as being weaker in the second half of 2015 through to the end of the first quarter of 2016, strengthening and then stabilizing in the second half of the year, before rising to a peak in May 2017. The second half of 2017 saw a decline in average monthly prices, but prices peaked once more in June 2018. Prices fell again in the second half of 2018, through 2019 and into 2020, before rising from the second half of the year. Prices continued to increase throughout 2021 and the first half of 2022, reaching $3.61 per kg by May, the highest level in 11 years. By mid-2023, however, prices were trending lower, reaching $2.11 per kg ($2,115 per ton) in August, as a result of historically high energy prices and associated challenges in the producing countries, specifically lower profit margins for spinning mills.

          <heading>Diamonds</heading>
          <!--This appears only in ASS. We use the USGS. The largest company info comes from USGS Yearbook on industrial diamonds GWJ 08/17-->
          <p id="ASS.MC.179">Diamonds are a crystalline form of carbon, and are the hardest naturally occurring substance. They are of two categories: gem qualities (among the most prized gemstones used in jewellery), which are superior in terms of colour or quality; and industrial quality, about one-half of the total by weight, which are used for high-precision machining or crushed into an abrasive powder called boart (bort). The primary source of diamonds is a rock known as kimberlite, occurring in volcanic pipes, which may vary in area from a few hectares to more than 100&#160;ha, and volcanic fissures, which are considerably smaller. Among the indicator minerals for kimberlite are chrome diopside, pyrope garnet, ilmenite and zircon. Few kimberlites contain diamonds, and in ore that does, the ratio of diamond to waste is about one part per 20m. There are four methods of diamond mining, of which open-cast mining is the commonest; diamonds are also recovered by underground, alluvial and, increasingly, offshore mining. The diamond is separated from its ore by careful crushing and gravity concentration, which maximizes the diamond’s high specific gravity in a process called dense media separation.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.180">The size of diamonds and other precious stones is measured in carats. One metric carat is equal to 0.2 gram, so one ounce avoirdupois equals 141.75 carats.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.181">Diamonds can also be formed artificially, although these are usually very small. Synthetic diamonds form the bulk of industrial use (99%), although since the end of the 20th century production of gem-quality synthetic diamonds of appreciable size has been possible. However, synthetic gemstone diamonds amount to only a few thousand carats per year (compared with some 90m. carats of natural gemstones); many of the so-called fancy diamonds, which are coloured other than clear, through yellow to brown, are synthetic—only 0.01% of natural diamonds are fancy. Production of synthetic diamonds, almost all of which are destined for industrial use, usually amounts to significantly more than the output of natural diamonds annually: 15,400m. carats in 2022, compared with 107m. carats of natural diamonds (45% industrial) in 2020, according to the latest available figures from the US Geological Survey (USGS). The People’s Republic of China is, overwhelmingly, the principal producer of synthetic diamonds (91% of 2011 production; the USA produced 2.2% and nine other countries the rest—these USGS figures exclude production by Germany and the Republic of Korea). In Africa, only South Africa produces synthetic diamonds (1.4% in 2011). The principal market for synthetic diamonds remains the USA. Synthetic diamonds are produced by simulating geological formation under high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) conditions, or by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). Although the largest volume of diamond production and commerce is for industrial purposes, the gemstone market accounts for some 90% of the value traded. Sub-Saharan Africa, therefore, which produces about one-half (48% in 2020—an estimated 46% from the top four African producers alone in 2022) of the world’s natural diamonds is the vital region in the diamond commodity market.</p>
          <p>In 2018, according to the USGS, De Beers (Switzerland/South Africa) and Alrosa (Russian Federation) are the world’s principal diamond-producing companies, with De Beers producing 23% of total global quantity of natural diamonds and 33% of the total value, and Alrosa 24% and 22%, respectively. Rio Tinto (United Kingdom/Australia) is responsible for 12% of global production quantity and 5% of value. In 2013 operators on the Chiadzwa alluvial fields in Zimbabwe contributed 8% of quantity and 4% of value, while the Catoca mine in Angola was itself responsible for about 5% of not only production quantity but value, given the high proportion of gemstones found.</p>
          <!--For the Table, in 2017 there still had not been an update of the diamond sections of the USGS, except for the annual summary, which is very rudimentary, but it provides another year for the footnote (revise the year before too) and a price (see below). GWJ 08/17-->

          <p id="ASS.MC.182">
               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       Africa is the major producing region for natural diamonds, although Australia joined the ranks of the major producers in 1983, and the Argyle open-cast diamond mine, in Western Australia, became the world’s largest producing mine and the main source of industrial diamonds—output is predominantly of industrial-grade diamonds, with some lower-quality gem diamonds and a few pink diamonds. In 1998 Australian diamond production represented almost one-third of world output by volume, but in the 2000s its pre-eminence was increasingly challenged by Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Russian Federation, reflecting a sharp decline in output at Argyle. Australia’s gemstone production collapsed almost entirely in 2007, while USGS recorded zero production of natural diamonds in Australia in 2021–22. Of the other major producers, Russia produced more gem diamonds than industrial ones in 2020, but of a comparable order of output, while Botswana produced mainly gemstones and the DRC mainly industrial diamonds. Canada is almost entirely, and Angola predominantly, a gemstone producer; by contrast, industrial diamond output accounted mostly for increased production in Zimbabwe from 2010. In 2020 Africa accounted for 47% of gem diamond production and 49% of natural industrial diamond production.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.183">The continent’s wealth in natural diamonds accounts for the dominance in the international trade of the great South African mining and trading house of De Beers. Founded in the late 19th century, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd controlled 90% of world diamond production by the beginning of the 1900s and proceeded to dominate the international trade in diamonds for the rest of that century. The company maintained a cartel by persuading or coercing independent producers to sell through its single marketing channel, while underpinning its control of supply by stockpiling. The Diamond Corporation, formed in 1930 by the major diamond producers, acted as the single channel through which most of the world’s rough diamond production would be sold. To stabilize the market, the corporation put surplus output into reserve, to be sold at a time when conditions were favourable. The corporation was one of a group of companies, based in London, United Kingdom, that constituted the Central Selling Organisation (CSO). Until the 1990s the CSO dealt with about 90% of the world natural diamond trade, but De Beers’ monopoly was challenged by Russian and Canadian interests, as well as by its loss of control of Australian output. Competition authorities were increasingly critical of the De Beers system, with its Russian deals attracting legal complications in Europe into the 2000s. Finally, in mid-2000 De Beers announced the abandonment of its monopoly of world diamond supply, in favour of adopting a more profitable demand-led business model; the `historical’ diamond stockpile had been sold off within four years. The successor to the CSO, the Diamond Trading Company (DTC), is still the leading marketing channel for natural diamonds, accounting for 40%–50% of the international trade in the 2000s. The parent company has been a Swiss-domiciled corporation, De Beers Centenary AG, since 1990, with De Beers Consolidated Mines retaining only the South African interests. De Beers still dominates the main national diamond ventures, joint ventures with the respective Governments, in Botswana and Namibia.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.185">In terms of value, Botswana now ranks as the world’s second largest producer of diamonds (behind the Russian Federation), which are the country’s principal source of export earnings, normally accounting for up to three-quarters of export receipts and for as much as one-half of government revenues. In 2022 the value of Botswana’s exports (f.o.b.) of diamonds represented 87% of the total value of the country’s merchandise exports. In the mid-2010s diamonds were reckoned to account for about 30% of GDP, although a sharp decline in the value of sales threatened the Botswanan economy into the end of the decade. The mines are all open-cast, but the feasibility of eventual underground mining at Jwaneng (considered the world’s richest diamond mine, based on the value of recovered diamonds) was being explored. Most diamond mining operations in Botswana are conducted by the Debswana Diamond Co (Pty) Ltd, which is owned equally by the Botswana Government and De Beers Centenary AG. Debswana is expected to be able to maintain diamond output at its 2002 level until around 2030. A new sales agreement with the Government announced in September 2011 consolidated the company’s position and also provided for the DTC to move its hitherto London-based sales and aggregation functions to the country from 2013. Almost three-quarters (70%) of Botswana’s natural diamond production in 2020 consisted of gemstones.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.186">By the early 2010s almost all diamond output in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is mainly derived from alluvial mining operations in Kasai Oriental, consists of industrial diamonds, of which the DRC (as Zaire) was the world’s principal producer until it was overtaken by Australia in 1986. In the 1990s as much as 50% of the DRC’s production of gem-&#160;or near-gem-quality stones was smuggled out of the country. In the 2010s, the DRC was Africa’s leading producer of industrial natural diamonds; globally, its main rivals are the Russian Federation and Australia. The Société Minière de Bakwanga (MIBA), in which the Government has an 80% share, holds the DRC diamond monopoly; MIBA accounted for 27% of annual capacity until the mid-2000s, the rest being artisanal. Since 2001, after some engagement with Zimbabwean military and Israeli interests, MIBA has operated an open-bidding and free market sales and export system. Artisanal production has been boosted by greater domestic political stability and by the implementation of the Kimberley Process (see below). The main MIBA site is at Mbuyi-Mayi. Almost all DRC diamond mining depended on artisanal production. In 2022 the value of the DRC’s foreign sales of diamonds, at an estimated US&#160;$130m., represented only 0.4% of its total export revenue (down from 61% in 2003, although that is largely because other exports have increased in importance in the intervening period).</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.187">De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd contributed the overwhelming bulk of South Africa’s diamond production. According to official sources, South Africa usually exports more rough diamonds than it produces domestically because of the re-export of imported diamonds supplied by the DTC to its clients—`sightholders’—and of diamonds imported by dealers and cutters. The country is the only African producer of synthetic diamonds, providing some 60m. carats annually, according to the USGS. Angola’s diamond output, which totalled 2.4m. carats in 1974, subsequently fell sharply as a consequence of the civil war. Production recovered substantially into the 2000s, and diamonds contributed 10.4% of the country’s total export earnings in 2001, although its share declined once petroleum exports became more important in the late 2000s. (In 2022 exports of diamonds accounted for 3.8% of Angola’s export earnings.) Most Guinean production, principally gemstones, is alluvial and artisanal. Namibian production, also mainly of gem-quality, suffers from high recovery costs, and the country has extensive offshore deposits. In 1994 the Namibian Government and De Beers established the Namdeb Diamond Corpn (Pty) Ltd, which is the country’s leading producer. In 2005, according to the Bank of Namibia, the diamond sector accounted for 41% of Namibia’s total export earnings and contributed 10% of the country’s GDP; in 2022 diamonds accounted for 22% of the value of exports.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.190">Other than the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Guinea and the Republic of the Congo, African countries whose diamond industries became tainted by the trade in `conflict diamonds’ were Sierra Leone, Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia. The Central African Republic was troubled more by the loss of diamond revenues to smuggling, as artisanal production was sold abroad illegally, but it hoped to benefit from certification (see below). In May 2013, however, diamond exports from the country were banned under the certification process, in an attempt to prevent `conflict diamonds’ sales financing the civil war; the export ban was only lifted in June 2016. In 2022—four years after the end of the ban—the country exported diamonds to the value of $14.3m., equivalent to 12.2% of the total value of exports that year (and some 24% more than the previous year). From 2010 Zimbabwean diamond production increased dramatically, despite international controversy over illicit diamond trading and dubious military involvement, and into the mid-2010s the country was exceeding Angolan production—although production fell dramatically in 2014–16, with Angolan production once more surpassing it. Production did recover some lost ground in 2017–20. Diamonds are still an important commodity to Zimbabwe’s export earnings (2.8% of the total value of exports in 2022). By contrast, countries such as Tanzania have strong and yet non-controversial production. The Mwadui diamond pipe in Tanzania was one of the world’s largest producing pipes, covering an area of 146&#160;ha. Tanzania’s diamond output was 838,000 carats in 1971, but by the late 1980s exports from Mwadui had effectively ceased. Following extensive rehabilitation, mining at Mwadui, and exports, recommenced in 1995. The country’s main producer recently has been the Williamson mine—mainly gem-quality stones. Diamonds contributed just 0.9% of Tanzania’s export revenues in 2022, but the export revenue ($62.7m.) represented an increase of 636% compared with the previous year, a phenomenon attributed to production at the Williamson mine (which, after a period of closure, was reopened). However, it was reported in late 2022 that production at the mine was to be suspended again, until mid-2023, following the collapse of a tailings dam. Ghana, which once had a flourishing diamond sector, regained fairly steady production for most of the 2000s. Lesotho has a small industry, while Mauritania and Mozambique both have hopes of benefiting from the exploitation of diamond reserves.</p>

               <b>Prices</b>
       Rough diamonds, of which there are currently more than 5,000 categories, were traditionally sold by the CSO in mixed packages 10 times each year at regular sales, known as `sights’, in London, Johannesburg, South Africa, and Lucerne, Switzerland. Gems accounted for about 20% of total sales by weight, but, it was estimated, more than 90% by value. After being sold by the CSO, gem diamonds were sent to be cut and polished in preparation for jewellery manufacture. The leading cutting centres were in Antwerp, Belgium, Mumbai, India, New York, USA, and Tel-Aviv, Israel; this last opened an exchange for `raw’, or uncut, diamonds in 1993, with the intention of lessening the dependence of Israeli cutters on allocations from the CSO and purchases from the small, independent diamond exchange in Antwerp. However, by 2003 it was reported that 92% of the world’s diamonds were cut and polished in Surat, India; higher grade diamonds tended to be dealt with in the older centres. Antwerp is the leading trading bourse.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.202">As there are so many varieties of diamond, changes to prices (quoted in US dollars) effected by the CSO and its successor, the DTC, represent averages only. There are wide discrepancies in price, depending on such factors as rarity, colour and quality. The level of the price for diamonds can be indicated by volume sales at the DTC, or by the unit value of South African diamond exports, but the USGS cites the value of imports to the USA.</p>

          <p>
               <b>`Conflict Diamonds’, Certification and the World Diamond Council</b>
       In the 1990s the increasing role of the world diamond trade in the financing of guerrilla insurgencies in Africa, with particular reference to Angola, Sierra Leone and the DRC, prompted the UN Security Council in June 1998 to adopt a resolution (No. 1173) requiring that international markets ensure that illicitly exported diamonds from these areas did not enter world trade. These `conflict diamonds’ were defined as diamonds that had been either mined or stolen by rebels in opposition to the legitimate government of a country (about 3.7% of world diamond production in 1999, according to De Beers).
    </p>
          <p>Despite the efforts to stem the trade in `conflict diamonds’, outlets for smuggled stones continued to operate, principally in Antwerp, Belgium, in Mumbai (Bombay), India, and in Tel-Aviv, Israel, while illicit output from guerrilla-controlled regions of Angola was marketed under false certification provided mainly by outlets in Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea and Liberia. In May 2000 southern African producing countries initiated what was termed the Kimberley Process, with the objective of ending the commercialization of `conflict diamonds’. Endorsed in December by the UN General Assembly, and subsequently expanded to involve, as of August 2013, some 54 participants representing 81 countries (including the European Union, whose 28 members count as a single participant), the Kimberley Process has established the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), which has since 1 January 2003 imposed strict standards on all of its participants in respect of trade in rough diamonds. In July 2000 representatives of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses and the International Diamond Manufacturers Association resolved to implement a certification system that would allow rough diamonds to be monitored direct from mines to trading centres. At the same time the World Diamond Council (WDC) was established in order to implement and monitor the certification system, with a complementary warranties system of its own. Both the UN Security Council (in 2003) and the UN General Assembly (in 2000—see above—and 2004) have adopted resolutions supporting the Kimberley Process. In 2013, according to the WDC, 99.8% of rough diamonds were certified under the KPCS. Both the UN and some non-governmental organizations, however, have documented anomalies within the Kimberley Process, alleging a failure to address non-compliance, and with some in 2010, for instance, urging a widening of the definition of `conflict diamonds’. In December 2011 one organization, Global Witness, even withdrew from the KPCS, alleging that the system was not working.</p>
          <p>Action was also taken at the country and company level. Although considerable technical difficulties exist in the identification of diamonds originating in conflict areas, De Beers, as the principal conduit for African diamond sales, implemented a range of measures to comply with UN Resolution 1173. In 2000 the company went so far as to introduce documentation guaranteeing customers that none of its marketed diamonds emanated from conflict areas of Africa. There was a particular problem in Angola. The report of a UN sanctions committee explicitly cited the Presidents of Togo and Burkina Faso, as well as Belgian, Bulgarian and Ukrainian officials, who were all accused of involvement in the illicit diamond trade and of providing military assistance to the União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA). As a result, the Diamond High Council in Antwerp entered into an origin verification agreement with the Angolan Government, which also initiated the restructuring of its national industry. In December 2002, following the death of the leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, the UN Security Council voted to end the sanctions that it had applied to UNITA’s diamond mining and selling operations; none the less, it was widely recognized that UNITA continued to dispose of large quantities of `conflict diamonds’. Given civil conflict in the Central African Republic and the temptation of armed groups to finance their activity through illegal diamond sales, diamond exports from the country were banned in 2013–16. Greater compliance with certification standards around the world continued to be encouraged by the Kimberley Process, which was again endorsed by the UN General Assembly in February 2017. In August 2022 it was reported that the USA and other Western opponents of the Russian Federations’s renewed armed invasion of Ukraine in the same year were seeking to classify Russian diamonds as `conflict diamonds’ in light of the ongoing hostilities.</p>

          <p id="ASS.MC.204">Gold minerals commonly occur in quartz, and are also found in alluvial deposits and in rich, thin underground veins. In South Africa gold occurs in sheets of low-grade ore (reefs) which may be at great depths below ground level. Gold is associated with silver, which is the commonest by-product of gold mining. Uranium oxide is another valuable by-product, particularly in the case of South Africa. Depending upon its associations, gold is separated by cyaniding, or else is concentrated and smelted. Gold is a dense, malleable metal, bright yellow in colour, and is one of the least reactive chemical elements.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.205">Gold, silver and platinum are customarily measured in troy weight. A troy pound (now obsolete) contains 12 ounces, each of 480 grains. One troy oz is equal to 31.1 grams (1&#160;kg&#160;=&#160;32.15 troy oz), compared with the avoirdupois oz of 28.3 grams. Gold purity is measured in carats, in parts per 24, with 24 carats being pure gold (for gemstones and pearls, a carat is a unit of weight).</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.206">In modern times the principal function of gold has been as bullion in reserve for bank notes issued. From the early 1970s, however, the USA actively sought to `demonetize’ gold and so to make it simply another commodity. This objective was later adopted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has attempted to end the position that gold occupied for many years in the international monetary system (see below). Gold remains an important investment commodity.</p>

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       As a portable real asset which is easily convertible into cash, gold is widely esteemed as a store of value. Another distinguishing feature of gold is that new production in any one year is very small in relation to existing stocks. Much of the world’s gold is in private bullion stocks, held for investment purposes, or is hoarded as a `hedge’ against inflation. Private investment stocks of gold throughout the world are estimated at 15,000–20,000 metric tons, much of it held in East Asia and India. By the beginning of 2013 the end of the decade-long bull run was apparent, as the gold price faltered. According to the World Gold Council, the first quarter of 2023 saw a 13% drop in demand for gold (excluding the over-the-counter market) compared to the same period of the previous year. The decline was attributed to investors’ decreased global holdings of exchange traded products (ETPs). Although modest, the net reduction of 29 tons was in stark contrast to the significant gains experienced in the first quarter of 2022. Meanwhile, a reduction in Indian demand in particular was believed to be the result of record high local prices for gold discouraging jewellery consumers and investors alike. Lower Indian demand was offset somewhat by an improved economic outlook in China following the cessation of its uncompromising COVID-19 containment policy in December 2022—with the associated improvement in local consumption. Global jewellery consumption levels were similar to those of the first quarter of 2022, while gold bar and coin investment grew by 5% over the same period. There was, however, a sharp decline in consumption of gold in the technology sector (principally electronics)—to just 70 tons (the second-lowest quarterly figure since 2000, and a sign of the many prevailing global economic difficulties).
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.207">Gold reserves were discovered near Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1884, and their exploitation formed the basis of the country’s subsequent economic prosperity. For more than 100 years South Africa was the world’s leading gold producer. In 2007, however, the country relinquished primacy to China, where output had been rising steadily since 1999. China’s position was confirmed in 2008 (when it accounted for 12% of world production), in which year the USA also exceeded South African production. By 2022 the output of 12 countries exceeded that of South Africa (including Burkina Faso, Ghana—Africa’s largest producer—and Mali). South Africa achieved its peak gold production in 1970, mining some 1,000 metric tons in that year. From the mid-1980s in particular the South African gold industry was adversely affected by the rising costs of extracting generally declining grades of ore from ageing and increasingly marginal (low return) mines. Additionally, the level of world gold prices was not sufficiently high to stimulate the active exploration and development of new mines. The share of gold in South Africa’s export revenue accordingly declined. and in 1989 the commercial profitability of South African gold production was for the first time exceeded by profits from mining activities other than gold. In 2006, for the first time since 1925, South Africa produced less than 300 tons of gold (295.7 tons). Lower grades of ore, new safety procedures but continuing concerns, power and other infrastructural problems, skills shortages and issues with organized labour all contributed to steadily declining production. By 2008 South Africa’s contribution to global mined production of gold had fallen to below one-10th for the first time in more than a century, having provided two-thirds in 1970. In 2022 gold still contributed 4.3% of South Africa’s total export revenue. That process of decline has also been accompanied by substantial increases in world output, as new capacity has been brought into production in other countries.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.209">From 2009 rising gold production elsewhere in Africa began to compensate for the continuing contraction in South African mining of the metal. Ghana, formerly a significant African producer of gold, had from 1990 begun to reverse a long period of decline, and by the end of the decade and into the new century was secure in its position as the second largest producer on the continent. By 2018 it had overtaken South Africa as the continent’s largest producer, a position it maintained in 2019–22. In 2022 exports of gold accounted for about 30% of Ghana’s total export revenue, which was down from 64% in 2010, despite continuing strength in the international gold price, because significant hydrocarbons exports began in the latter year. As petroleum exports became stronger and more consistent, so did gold’s share stabilize in 2014. Gold production in Mali increased substantially from 1997, reflecting the exploitation of deposits at Sadiola Hill, and from 2009 was bolstered to an extent by increasing production at new mines. Most mining operations were located in the south of the country, so activity was little affected by the political upheavals in 2012. In 2022 gold was still overwhelmingly Mali’s most important source of export revenue, accounting for 83% of the country’s total export earnings. Artisanal production (31% of the total in 2016) boosted gold output in 2015–19 in particular; however, there was a drop in artisanal exports in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing political instability. (A military coup had unseated President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta that year and forced the dissolution of the country’s parliament.) Meanwhile Tanzania had began to challenge Mali for third place among African producers, its first large-scale gold mine commenced operations in 1998. A subsequent mine, the Geita project, is the largest producer of gold in East Africa. Tanzania recorded an increase of almost 87% in its output in 2000, and in 2001 production almost doubled. Production thus rose from 17.2 metric tons in 2000 to peaks of 49.3 tons in 2005 and 49.6 tons in 2011, but output was vulnerable to labour disputes, problems with the encroachment of artisanal miners, high inflation and, increasingly, low-grade or depleted resources. By 2022 Tanzania ranked as only the continent’s sixth largest producer. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was Africa’s seventh largest producer of gold in 2022, although there were concerns about the prevalence of `conflict’ gold serving to finance armed groups.</p>
          <p>Burkinabè production had risen slowly through the 2000s, and in 2008 five large-scale mines came into production in Burkina Faso. In mid-2010 the Inata mine of Avocet Mining and the Essakane mine of IAMGOLD began commercial production, alone contributing almost one-third of Burkinabè output in that year and accounting for most of the boost in 2011 production. By 2022 the country was Africa’s third largest producer. Equipment issues sometimes limited output, but the general impact on national exports was apparent: the contribution of gems and precious metals (overwhelmingly gold) went from 2% in 2007 to 75% by 2012—gold provided 74% of the value of total exports in 2022. In Guinea, meanwhile, output rose from the mid-2010s onwards. The country continued to move up the rankings of African gold producers into the 2020s; it was the sixth largest producer in the region in 2022. Meanwhile, in Sudan the high gold price encouraged a leap in production from 2009 (output peaked at 88.0 tons in 2017). Sudan, the DRC and Ethiopia all relied on artisanal production to boost output. Zimbabwean gold production also increased, doubling between 2008 and 2011. Gold had been overtaken in 1980 by tobacco as the country’s major source of foreign exchange, and the gold mining industry had contracted substantially, not helped by political and economic problems in the country. Contracting output had fallen as low as 8.9 tons by 2008 (taking Zimbabwean gold production to its lowest level in 90 years), before gradual recovery. In 2022 Zimbabwe produced 49.4 metric tons of gold. Ethiopia and Eritrea also produced some gold; the former’s output had reached 10.0 tons in 2020.</p>
          <p>Côte d’Ivoire’s Tongon mine poured its first gold in November 2010, and the increasing production from it more than offset interruptions to supply from other mines owing to civil unrest in 2011. National output reached a record 48.0 metric tons in 2022, putting the country in ninth place among African gold producers. Commercial production at the Sabodala open-pit mine in Senegal began in 2009, taking that country’s gold output from 0.1 tons annually to a peak of 17.3 tons in 2019; production was 19.7 tons in 2022. Mauritania’s output increased from less than 1.0 tons annually to 1.9 tons in 2007 and 19.3 tons in 2022. The only significant North African producer is Egypt, which, according to USGS figures, produced 12.9 tons in 2021 (from negligible production as late as 2009). Liberia began commercial production at its New Liberty mine during 2016; according to USGS figures, the country produced an estimated 7.8 tons in 2021. Less significant African producers included Zambia (4.0 tons in 2021—USGS figures), Niger and, for the first time in 2013, Gabon, where the new Bakoudou-Magnima operation produced 1 ton of gold. </p>

               <!--Gold is a unique and fundamental commodity so it has two prices tables! Both are sourced from GFMS. First, LBM price, note it is the afternoon fix (second column). The Appendix to the Gold Survey only deals with one year, the most recent one, but you can check you have the right figure by looking in the summary Supply and Demand table at the very beginning of the Gold Survey. The fiddly bit is the highest and lowest daily prices. You have to look on the London Bullion Market website - search for LBM gold price or something (www.lbma.org.uk/pricing-and-statistics) - which has a record of prices (you want a table of daily prices for gold). Just look up and down the second (pm) column, or get an idea of where it is by googling. Secondly, the table with the prices in various currencies simply comes from the GFMS Appendix. There has not been a big table of prices in different currencies over the years since the 2014 Survey, so we just hope that the prices for that year are in the same series as in previous years. They are, but keep an eye out. This year (2017) I changed the yuan price to a yen price, because the yuan stopped being done. GWJ 08/17-->

               <b>Prices</b>
       The unit of dealing in international gold markets is the `good delivery’ gold bar, weighing about 400&#160;oz (12.5&#160;kg). The principal centres for gold trading are London, Hong Kong and Zürich, Switzerland. The dominant markets for gold futures (buying and selling for future delivery) are the New York Commodity Exchange (COMEX) in the USA and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) in Japan. A small group of dealers meets twice on each working day (morning and afternoon) to `fix’ the price of gold in the London Bullion Market (LBM), and the tables above are based on the second of these daily `fixes’. During any trading day, however, prices may fluctuate above or below these levels. (A new LBM Association gold price was launched on 20 March 2015, to be operated by an independent third-party provider, ICE Benchmark Administration—IBA.) Prices in other markets and other currencies vary. In real terms, the average annual London gold price reached a record height in 1980. Between 1980 and 2001 the LBM gold price reflected a significant fall in the price of the commodity (from an average of US&#160;$615 per troy oz in the earlier year to just $271 per troy oz in the latter). The rise in the average annual price of gold through the 2008 collapse in commodity prices and the onset of global recession was pronounced. During global crises, investors often look to gold as a so-called `safe haven’, which places upward pressure on prices. Indeed, following the twin crises of the early 2020s (the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s renewed military invasion of Ukraine), gold reached record daily highs (breaching $2,000 per troy oz multiple times during that period). In April 2023 the monthly price averaged more than $2,000 per troy oz for the first time in history. By July 2023 the price had settled a little, to average $1,947.80 per troy oz.

          <p>
               <b>Gold: Monetization and Demonetization</b>
       During the 19th century gold was increasingly adopted as a monetary standard, with prices set by governments. In 1919 the Bank of England allowed some South African gold to be traded in London `at the best price obtainable’. The market was suspended in 1925–31, when sterling returned to a limited form of the gold standard, and again in 1939–54. In 1934 the official price of gold was fixed at US&#160;$35 per troy oz and, by international agreement, all transactions in gold had to take place within narrow margins around that price. In 1960 the official gold price came under pressure from market demand. As a result, an international gold `pool’ was established in 1961 at the initiative of the USA. Originally a consortium of leading central banks with the object of restraining the London price of gold in case of excessive demand, it later widened into an arrangement by which eight central banks agreed that all purchases and sales of gold should be handled by the Bank of England. However, growing private demand for gold continued to exert pressure on the official price, and the gold `pool’ was ended in 1968, in favour of a two tier price system. Central banks continued to operate the official price of $35 per oz, but private markets were permitted to deal freely in gold. However, the free market price did not rise significantly above the official price. In August 1971 the USA announced that it would cease dealing freely in gold to maintain exchange rates for the dollar within previously agreed margins. This `floating’ of the dollar against other major currencies continued until December, when it was agreed to raise the official gold price to $38 per oz. Gold prices on the free market rose to $70 per oz in August 1972. In February 1973 the US dollar was devalued by a further 10%, the official gold price rising to $42.22 per oz. Thereafter the free market price rose even higher, reaching $127 per oz in June 1973. In November it was announced that the two tier system would be terminated, and from 1974 governments were permitted to value their official gold stocks at market prices.
    </p>
          <p>In 1969 the IMF had introduced a new unit for international monetary dealings, the special drawing right (SDR), with a value of US&#160;$1.00, and the first allocation of SDRs was made on 1 January 1971. The SDR was linked to gold at an exchange rate of SDR&#160;35 per troy oz, but this came under pressure from the devaluations of the US currency, and in July 1974 the direct link between the SDR and the US dollar was ended. Instead, the SDR was valued in terms of a weighted `basket’ of national currencies. At the same time the official gold price of SDR&#160;35 per troy oz was retained as the IMF’s basis for valuing official reserves. In 1976 the membership of the IMF agreed on proposals for far reaching changes in the international monetary system. These reforms, which were implemented on a gradual basis during 1977–81, included a reduction in the role of gold in the international system and the abolition of the official price of gold. A principal objective of the IMF plan was achieved in April 1978, when central banks were able to buy and sell gold at market prices. The physical quantity of reserve gold held by the IMF and member countries’ central banks as national reserves has subsequently fallen (see below). The USA still maintains the largest national stock of gold, although the volume of its reserves has been substantially reduced. At the end of 1949 US gold reserves were 701.8m.&#160;oz, but since the beginning of the 1980s the level has been in the range of 261.4m.–264.6m.&#160;oz. At July 2023 US gold reserves reportedly stood at 8,133 tons, or 261.5m. oz.</p>
          <p>During 1996 substantial amounts of gold bullion, jointly exceeding 500 metric tons, were sold by the central banks of Belgium and the Netherlands, and the Swiss National Bank announced its intention to allocate part of its gold reserves to fund a new humanitarian foundation. In the same year the UK first suggested a scheme to use some sales of IMF gold to finance debt relief for the world’s poorest countries, principally in Africa. In July 1997 the Reserve Bank of Australia announced that it had disposed of more than two-thirds of its bullion holdings (reducing its reserves from 247 tons to 80 tons) over the previous six months. National sales of gold became far more common and, in response to concerns that the official sector’s unco-ordinated gold sales were depressing gold prices, in 1999 the European Central Bank (ECB), in a joint statement with the central banks of Switzerland and 13 members of the European Union (Sweden, the UK and the 11 countries then in the eurozone), announced a five-year moratorium on new sales of gold held in official reserves. Total gold reserves held by the 15 signatory banks totalled 16,336 metric tons, accounting for around 48% of global gold reserves. The agreement—referred to as the Central Bank Gold Agreement (CBGA) and also known as the Washington Agreement on gold—allowed impending sales that had already been decided to proceed, although total sales were not to exceed 400 tons per year over the five-year period. The announcement also stated that gold would remain an important element of global monetary reserves. The European agreement was generally welcomed for removing uncertainty from the gold market, although the permitted rate of sales (400 tons per year) was more than 100% greater than the average net sales by the signatory countries in 1989–98. In March 2004 the renewal of the CBGA was announced, to cover the five-year period from September 2004 to September 2009, without the UK but with Greece as a new signatory. The second CBGA ended the moratorium on sales not already decided, and annual sales quotas were raised to 500 tons in order to take into account the consolidation of the price of gold that had occurred. Slovenia became a signatory of the second CBGA in December 2006, immediately prior to its adoption of the euro as its currency. Cyprus and Malta likewise became CBGA signatories on adopting the euro in January 2008, as did Slovakia in January 2009. The third CBGA entered effect at the end of September 2009, with the same signatories as those to the second agreement. Under the new CBGA, covering the five-year period to 2014, the cap on annual sales was again reduced to 400 tons (with the signatories noting that the intention of the IMF to sell 403 tons of gold could be accommodated within the overall quotas). Despite speculation that the low level of official sales made a fourth CBGA unnecessary, a new five-year agreement was concluded in May 2014 and it took effect on 27 September; the cap on sales was removed, but this marked the end of the era of significant official gold sales. It was reported in mid-2019 that the ECB and 21 other European central banks would not be renewing the CBGA for a fourth time, citing the maturity of the gold market as the reason for its decision.</p>

      The groundnut or peanut is not a true nut, although the underground pod, which contains the kernels, forms a more or less dry shell at maturity. The plant is a low growing annual herb introduced from South America, and resembles the indigenous African Bambarra groundnut (
      <i>Vigna subterranea</i>
      ), which it now outnumbers. Groundnuts that come to market generally consist of one of the four main types: runner, Spanish, Virginia and Valencia.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.236">Each groundnut pod contains between two and four kernels, enclosed in a reddish skin. The kernels are highly nutritious because of their high content of both protein (about 30%) and oil (40%–50%). In tropical countries the crop is grown partly for domestic consumption and partly for export. Whole nuts of selected large dessert types, with the skin removed, are eaten raw or roasted. Peanut butter is made by removing the skin and germ and grinding the roasted nuts. The most important commercial use of groundnuts is the extraction of oil. Groundnut oil is used as a cooking and salad oil, as an ingredient in margarine, and, in the case of lower quality oil, in soap manufacture. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the world’s most produced vegetable oils are palm oil and soybean oil, then rapeseed oil and sunflowerseed oil, and distantly followed by palm kernel oil, groundnut oil and cottonseed oil (then coconut oil and olive oil). Consumption followed a similar pattern, but in terms of world exports palm oil was by far the most important vegetable oil, with groundnut oil eighth of the nine listed by USDA for 2022/23. Oilseed production, however, in volume terms, is dominated by soybean, followed by rapeseed, cottonseed, sunflowerseed and groundnut, then palm kernel and copra.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.241">
      An oilcake, used in animal feeding, is manufactured from the groundnut residue left after oil extraction. However, trade in this groundnut meal is limited by health laws in some countries, as groundnuts can be contaminated by a mould which generates toxic and carcinogenic metabolites, the most common and most dangerous of which is aflatoxin B
      <sub>1</sub>
      . The European Union (EU) has banned imports for use as animal feed of oilcake and meal which contain more than 0.03 mg of aflatoxin per&#160;kg. The meal can be treated with ammonia, which both eliminates the aflatoxin and enriches the cake. Groundnut shells, which are usually incinerated or simply discarded as waste, can be converted into a low-cost organic fertilizer, which has been produced since the early 1970s.

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       Since the late 20th century more than 90% of the world’s groundnut output has come from developing countries. Groundnuts are the most important of Africa’s oilseeds and form the chief export crop of The Gambia and, traditionally, Senegal (which still exports groundnut oil in reasonable quantities). According to USDA, sub-Saharan Africa’s exports accounted for 23% of the world total in 2022/23; only 7% of African production was exported in that year. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for about one-fifth (20% in 2022/23) of world production of groundnut oil. The world’s largest exporters of groundnut oil were Brazil, India, Argentina, Sudan, Senegal, Mali, Nicaragua, China and the USA. Many of the large African producers provided increasingly for domestic consumption. In 2018 exports of groundnuts and groundnut products contributed just 3% of The Gambia’s total revenue from exports (including re-exports) after a declining trend (although this figure was based on total exports that were less than one-half of the previous year). The Gambia exported no groundnuts in 2019–20, but exports contributed 8% of the country’s total export revenue in 2021. Malawi, an erratic but often strong exporter, earned 9% of the value of its exports from groundnuts in 2022. Nigeria, Africa’s largest producer by some margin, was chiefly engaged in feeding only its own burgeoning internal market by the 2010s, and the country had become less relevant to international markets, except in the export of groundnuts. The traditional West African groundnut states were reinforced by production in the Sahel and southern Africa, although both were vulnerable to devastation by drought, as was the case in Sudan.

               <b>Regional Council</b>
       The African Groundnut Council was founded in 1964 to advise its member producing countries (The Gambia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan) on marketing policies. It is based in Kano, Nigeria (having relocated from Lagos in 2005), and has a sales promotion office in Geneva, Switzerland. Western Europe, particularly France, has traditionally been the principal market for African groundnuts.

               <b>Prices</b>
       Groundnuts are traded unprocessed or as the oil. The international indicator prices here are for US runner peanuts (40/50, unshelled) (c.f.r. north-west Europe). The groundnut oil import price (f.o.b. south-east) is generally more volatile than that for groundnuts. The average monthly price for groundnuts grew throughout 2016 and into 2017. Prices declined once more from early 2017 and into much of 2018, but recovered substantially in late 2019 and early 2020—averaging US&#160;$2,050 per metric ton in April–June, the highest level since January 2013. However, the average monthly price for groundnuts was generally lower thereafter, although it had reached&#160;$2,000 per ton by August 2023. Meanwhile, the price of groundnut oil had reached $2,174 per ton by August 2023. The increased prices were attributed, initially in 2021, to greater consumer demand during periods of government-enforced `lockdown’ around the world (to contain the COVID-19 pandemic), as households traditionally consume groundnut oil—this in preference to commercially favoured oils such as palm oil, which experienced significant price declines as restaurants and hotels remained closed. Sustained price growth in 2022–23 was largely the result of the ongoing war in Ukraine (usually a significant exporter of sunflower oils), which caused supply disruptions and placed upward pressure on the price of edible oils, as a consequence of which demand for compressed oils (such as groundnut oil manufactures) increased.

          <!--This does not appear again, so no need to copy on. From USGS, you will need iron ore (By Commodity, then I for Iron Ore) and then its Summary (pdf, dated the current year) and Yearbook section (pdf below, same page - check the date on the bottom of the first page to check it updated since last Europa update). I suggest opening both in separate windows. Later, you will also need USGS steel, for the Summary, and the Yearbook chapter for the countries. Text: nothing to update but, longer term, keep an eye on the DRI information. Table: update the main table from the Yearbook information (NB. metal content figures). Take a view on which countries to include. The footnote with the two most recent years and just the main producers comes from the USGS iron ore Summary BUT use usable ore figures, not metal content, because they will not be directly comparable and come from different series. If copied from earlier region, remember to add in South Africa. WMR text: the first paragraph is updated from the ISSB site (News Update/Global Overview www.issb.co.uk/news/news/global.html), with details about steel production/trade and, further down, iron ore trade. Have found nothing more recent from UNCTAD or on companies, which get to be a problem if the figures become too dated. Keep your eye out for news, basically. Generally, for country specific stuff, use the USGS or the Europa country chapter statistics for up-to-date trade data (not always there, but is for Brazil: iron ore, and iron and steel). Perhaps you have access to more detailed trade information. With Africa in particular, there is no avoiding googling specific projects. International Association: no need to update usually - check APEF occasionally. Prices: use the Pink Sheet data, the annual spreadsheet for first column and the monthly one to see highest and lowest for last year. Look at monthly trends to update the last sentence or two of the blurb. GWJ 08/17-->
          <p id="ASS.MC.249">Iron is, after silicon and aluminium, the third most abundant metallic element in the earth’s crust, and its ore volume production is far greater than that of any other metal. Some ores contain 70% iron, while a grade of only 25% is commercially exploitable in certain areas. The main economic iron-ore minerals are magnetite and haematite, which are used almost exclusively to produce pig-iron and direct-reduced iron (DRI—also known as sponge iron). These comprise the principal raw materials for the production of crude steel (which makes up about 95% of global metal production).</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.250">Most iron ore is processed after mining to improve its chemical and physical characteristics, and is often agglomerated by pelletizing or sintering. The transformation of the ore into pig-iron is achieved through reduction by coke in blast furnaces; the proportion of ore to pig-iron yielded is usually about 1.5:1 or 1.6:1. Pig-iron is used to make cast iron and wrought iron products, but most of it is converted into steel by removing most of the carbon content. Particular grades of steel (e.g. stainless) are made by the addition of ferro-alloys such as chromium, nickel and manganese. From the 1990s processing technology was being developed in the use of high-grade ore to produce DRI, or sponge iron, which, unlike the iron used for traditional blast furnace operations, requires no melting or refining. The DRI process, which is based on the use of natural gas, expanded rapidly in Venezuela, but, owing to technological limitations, is not expected within the foreseeable future to replace more than a small proportion of the world’s traditional blast furnace output. Venezuela and Mexico were the leading producers of DRI into the beginning of the 21st century, but India became increasingly the world’s largest single producer from 2003 (Venezuelan production fell dramatically in the 2010s). The energy-rich Middle East and North Africa was the leading producing region for DRI.</p>

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       As the basic feedstock for the production of steel, iron ore is a major raw material in the world economy and in international trade. After petroleum, the iron ore trade is the second largest commodity market by value (but still generally equivalent to less than one-10th of the crude market). Mining the ore usually involves substantial long-term investment, so until about 2010 up to 60% of trade was conducted under long-term contracts, while the mine investments were financed with some participation from consumers. Stability was undermined by the arrival of the People’s Republic of China on the international markets; in 2004 China surpassed Japan as the world’s leading importer, and its burgeoning internal market ended a system based on steady slow growth in the iron ore mining sector. After the international financial crisis in 2008 particularly, but also given preceding commodity price fluctuations, producers became frustrated with the inflexibility of long-term contracts and began to favour quarterly and then monthly average-based contracts, or `spot’ pricing, thereby fuelling a derivatives market (see below).
    </p>
          <p>The international trade in iron ore expanded in 2019. In that year, on the basis of data compiled by the USGS, a little more than one-half of world exports of iron ore were provided by Australia (54%) and almost one-quarter by Brazil (24%), followed by South Africa (4%). India, previously an important exporter, faced problems in dealing with illegal mining from 2010 and exports collapsed (see below). According to data from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Trust Fund Project on Iron Ore Information, between 2001 and 2010 four countries—the People’s Republic of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and Germany—had consistently accounted for more than two-thirds of all world imports of iron ore; over that period, however, China’s share in the world total had gone from 19% to 59%, while Japan’s share declined from 26% to 13%, South Korea’s from 9% to 5% and Germany’s from 8% to 4%. Iron ore exports globally had doubled between 1999 and 2008, mainly owing to increased demand from China. In 2020 the USGS reported that world exports of iron ore had reached 10.4m. metric tons, with a total value of US&#160;$839m. The three largest iron ore producing companies in the world in 2021 were Vale (320m. tons annually), Rio Tinto (277m. tons) and BHP Billiton (245m. tons). The three companies are even more significant in export markets, controlling 57% of the world seaborne trade of iron ore in 2011. The fourth largest producer, Fortescue Metals Group of Australia, increased output significantly in the first half of the 2010s, and by 2014 the top four companies were reckoned to control almost 70% of seaborne iron ore demand.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.251">Iron ore is widely distributed throughout Africa, with several countries having substantial reserves of high-grade deposits (60%–68% iron). Africa was expected to be supplying about 10% of the world’s iron ore supply by 2025 (compared with 4% in 2010), as well as processing more ore domestically. One of the world’s largest unexploited iron ore deposits (with estimated resources of more than 560m. metric tons, with a metal content of 64%) is located at Bélinga, in remote north-east Gabon. In August 2022 it was reported that a joint venture had been agreed between Fortescue Metals (Australia) and the Government of Gabon to begin development of the 4,500-sq km area. The deal for the Bélinga iron ore project included a US&#160;$90m. exploration programme. Annual output from the Bélinga project was ultimately expected to reach 20m.–30m. tons of ore. In early 2023 Fortescue suggested the project required $200m. in capital investment for early stage operations. In Senegal, the development of the country’s Falémé iron ore project and accompanying infrastructure was also mired in controversy and delay. Côte d’Ivoire’s as yet unexploited resources of iron ore were estimated at 3,000m. tons (40% iron) in 2003. Tata Steel agreed at the end of 2007 to conduct exploratory and feasibility work on the Mount Nimba deposit. The Mount Nimba iron ore reserves, estimated at 1,000m. tons, extended into two other countries—Liberia and Guinea—and the Côte d’Ivoire mine was at one time expected to begin production in 2016, but market conditions militated against this, as well the failure to build, as yet, a railway to a new port at San Pedro. ArcelorMittal began iron ore production at the Liberia site in September 2011, while the first iron ore mine in Guinea commenced operations in mid-2012. Other iron ore reserves in Guinea include the Pic du Fon deposit, totalling an estimated 1,200m. tons, at Simandou, one of the world’s few remaining unexploited iron ore resources and probably to be the largest integrated iron ore mine and infrastructure project in Africa. Allegations of corruption (BSG Resources of Switzerland was accused of obtaining the rights corruptly, an official inquiry finding the company guilty in 2014), court cases and reassessment of mining policies by the new regime frustrated the development of the deposits and first shipments seemed unlikely before the end of the decade. Meanwhile, in 2009 Xstrata of Switzerland announced investment of $50m. in exploration of the Zanaga iron ore deposits in the Republic of the Congo.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.252">The continent’s leading producer of iron ore is South Africa, and that country’s export sales are mainly destined for Pacific Rim countries. In 2022 iron ore exports earned 5% of total export revenues; a further 5% of total income from exports was earned from iron and steel. The country’s two principal iron ore concerns, Kumba Iron Ore (KIO) and Assmang, both continued to invest in iron ore production in South Africa. Highveld is also an important iron ore miner, and there are two other, smaller operations.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.256">Among the African producers of iron ore, the country most dependent on the mineral as a source of foreign exchange is Mauritania, which still derived 35% of its total export earnings from shipments of iron ore in 2022, despite notable petroleum production, which began in 2006, and the increase in gold exports, for example. However, export revenue from iron ore was down 25% on the previous year. The Société Nationale Industrielle et Minière (SNIM), which has sole responsibility for iron ore production and beneficiation, operated a mining centre at the northern town of Zouérate, three open-pit iron ore mines and transport infrastructure including a railway linking the mining centre with port facilities at Nouadhibou. Investment in existing sources of output, as well as new projects, continued into the 2010s. Kenya produces a small amount of iron ore, while iron ore deposits in Nigeria seem barely to be exploited; unofficially estimated in 1999 to exceed 3,000m. metric tons, mining commenced in 1986, but in the 2010s remained at a low level. In 1980 deposits estimated at 20m. tons of ore (50% iron) were identified in the west of Zambia, but these remained unexploited more than 40 years later. Tanzania has ore reserves estimated at 45m. tons (52% iron) at Liganga and 8m. tons (40% iron) in the Uluguru Mountains. Zimbabwean production, exceeding 350m. tons in some years until 2005, declined thereafter, and was put at just 50m. tons in 2007 and one-half of that amount in 2008 (the last recorded year of production). Iron ore mining in Angola was beset by civil conflict and was abandoned in 1975. Angola holds considerable ore production stockpiles, but the resumption of export trade in the ore depends on the eventual rehabilitation of the 520-km rail link between mines at Cassinga and the coast. The revived Marampa mine and the new Tonkolili project in Sierra Leone helped to fuel high growth in the country from 2011 and accounted for an estimated 16% of gross domestic product just before they closed, owing to financial problems in 2015. The ore deposits have an iron content of 69%, which tempted Chinese firm Shandong Iron and Steel into taking over and resuming operations in 2016, although it was announced in August 2019 that the Government had cancelled its operating licence. Liberia has abandoned stockpiles of iron ore from the old Yekepa works, but also the Mount Nimba iron ore reserves in the west of the country. ArcelorMittal Liberia assumed responsibility for mining these, under a 2005 agreement with the Government, and it expected its mines’ capacity to be 15m. tons of iron ore concentrate per year from 2015. Madagascar has an iron ore deposit at Bekipsa, the rights to which are held by Canadian company Cline.</p>

               <b>International Association</b>
       The Association of Iron Ore Exporting Countries (Association des Pays Exportateurs de Minerai de Fer—APEF) was established in 1975 to promote close co-operation among members, to safeguard their interests as iron ore exporters, to ensure the orderly growth of international trade in iron ore, and to secure `fair and remunerative’ returns from its exploitation, processing and marketing. Since 1975 APEF, which also collects and disseminates information on iron ore from its secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland, has had nine members: Algeria, Australia, Chile, India, Mauritania, Peru, Sierra Leone, Tunisia and Venezuela.

               <b>Prices</b>
       Until 2009 world reference prices for iron ore were decided annually at a series of meetings between producers and purchasers (the steel industry accounts for about 95% of all iron ore consumption), but when China failed to agree prices with major producers, and with `spot’ prices for iron ore soaring in the latter half of that year when miners were still selling at prices agreed in March, the system effectively collapsed in 2010. The USA and the republics of the former USSR, although major steel producers, rely on domestic ore production and had taken little part in the price negotiations. It was generally accepted that, because of its diversity in form and quality, iron ore was ill-suited to price stabilization through an international buffer stock arrangement.
    </p>
          <p>
      Given the complexity of the old pricing system, a general trend can be indicated from the prices cited by the World Bank—the average `spot’ price per dry metric ton (cost and freight) to China of iron ore (fines, 62% 
      <i>Fe</i>
      ) of any origin. By the 2000s Chinese demand was the principal determinant of prices in the international iron ore trade, although various fears about prospects for growth in the world economy have contributed to price volatility. With supply problems easing by 2015, as new capacity finally began to enter production, prices were tending downwards until the end of 2015, only strengthening into 2016 in line with renewed Chinese demand. The December 2015 average monthly price was the lowest figure since December 2004; prices improved generally over 2016 but were erratic throughout 2017 and 2018. Prices began to climb from early 2019, but fell back down in the second half of that year and the first half of 2020; from the middle of 2020 and through the first half of 2021, however, prices increased substantially, to reach $214 per ton in June, their highest ever level. The rising prices were attributed to strong demand from China, and mine closures in Brazil and China putting further pressure on existing supply constraints. Prices fell dramatically thereafter as mined output outstripped demand, especially in China (where the uncompromising state COVID-19 containment policy disrupted steel production). Prices recovered somewhat in early 2023 as China’s COVID containment regulations eased, but prices had fallen again by the middle of the year; the price averaged just $110 per ton in August.

          <!--This appears in one more region, so copy from ASS to FEA. We use USDA. Table: the FAO figures had not been updated in 2017, so I brought Maize (Corn) into line with Rice and Wheat in SAsia/SACAC by replacing with figures from USDA. I put in countries listed as major producers in the WMPTR, which seemed to be those that had produced more than 7m. tons in any of the four years, but I checked against PSD Online. Ponder the figures each time you update, but the African regional producers were included in 2017 if any year was above 3m. tons, I think. Adapt as necessary. The World Market and Region (WMR) text: the blurb is quite easy to update and relies on the USDA figures from the August (hopefully) WMPTR. The Africa stuff starts with imports: the WMPTR has a regional indicators sheet for corn (after coarse grains in general). Use PSD Online to update on countries. Global Forum: I have added in the International Grains Council. Prices: use the Pink Sheet data GWJ Aug 17-->
          <p id="ASS.MC.264">Maize is one of the world’s three principal cereal crops, with wheat and rice. Originally from the Americas, maize has been dispersed to many parts of the world. The principal varieties are dent maize (which has large, soft, flat grains) and flint maize (which has round, hard grains). Dent maize is the predominant type worldwide, but flint maize is widely grown in southern Africa. Maize may be white or yellow (there is little nutritional difference), but the former is preferred for human consumption in Africa. Maize is an annual crop, planted from seed, and matures within three to five months. It requires a warm climate and ample water supplies during the growing season. Genetically modified varieties of maize, with improved resistance to pests, are now being cultivated, particularly in the USA and also in Argentina and the People’s Republic of China. However, further development of genetically modified maize may be slowed by consumer resistance in importing countries and doubts about its environmental impact.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.265">Maize is an important foodstuff in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and the tropical zones of Latin America, where the climate precludes the extensive cultivation of other cereals. It is, however, inferior in nutritive value to wheat, being especially deficient in lysine, and tends to be replaced by wheat in diets when the opportunity arises. In many African countries the grain is ground into a meal, mixed with water, and boiled to produce a gruel or porridge. In other areas it is made into (unleavened) corn bread or breakfast cereals. Maize is also the source of an oil used in cooking.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.270">The high starch content of maize makes it highly suitable as a compound feed ingredient, especially for pigs and poultry. Animal feeding is the main use of maize in the USA, Europe and Japan, and large amounts are also used for feed in developing countries in the Far East, South Asia, Latin America and, to some extent, in North Africa. Maize has a variety of industrial uses, including the preparation of ethyl alcohol (ethanol), which may be added to petrol to produce a blended motor fuel. Maize is also a source of dextrose and fructose, which can be used as artificial sweeteners, many times sweeter than sugar. The amounts of maize used for these purposes depend, critically, on its price to the users relative to that of petroleum, sugar and other potential raw materials. Maize cobs, previously discarded as a waste product, may be used as feedstock to produce various chemicals (e.g. acetic acid and formic acid).</p>

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       The USA is by far the largest producer of maize (in years of drought or excessive heat, US output can fall dramatically) and the People’s Republic of China, whose maize output has been expanding rapidly, is the second largest producer—its harvest doubled in 2000–13. China’s production, however, is mainly destined for the domestic market, whereas US output had made the country generally the world’s largest exporter by far (although Brazilian exports had in recent years caught up, aided in part by a new supply agreement with China, while US prices—including freight rates—in 2022/23 proved uncompetitive). Figures from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for 2022/23 showed that Brazilian exports provided 32% of total world sales abroad, while the USA provided 23%, Ukraine 16% and Argentina 12%. Brazilian exports that year were four times their level in 2015/16 when there had been a poor harvest. The world’s principal maize importer was for many years Japan, though it was surpassed by Mexico in 2017/18–2022/23 (and by the People’s Republic of China from 2020/21—when that country became the world’s largest importer, due in large part to its dwindling domestic stockpiles), according to preliminary figures. The volume of Japanese imports remained stable through the 2000s, as the domestic livestock industry was rationalized to compete with imported meat. Japanese imports of maize totalled about 15.0m. metric tons in 2022/23. The European Union (EU), meanwhile, imported 24.5m. tons in 2022/23, mostly from Ukraine. Apart from Japan and Mexico, rapidly growing livestock industries elsewhere in East Asia made the region the major world market for maize, although in terms of individual countries the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) generally qualify as the other important markets for maize (18.0m. tons and 11.6m. tons, respectively, in 2022/23). Viet Nam is also among the world’s largest importers (9.8m. tons), with Iran (8.6m. tons) and Colombia (6.0m. tons) also significant customers in 2022/23. Egypt is by far the largest importer in the African continent, but bought just 5.0m. tons in 2022/23 (down from 10.4m. tons three years earlier).
    </p>
          <p>Maize imports by sub-Saharan Africa vary from around 1m. metric tons annually in years of good crops to far higher amounts after droughts. In 1992/93, for example, these imports exceeded 8m. metric tons, most of which entered through South African ports, either for that country’s own use or for onward transport overland to neighbouring countries. In 2022/23, according to USDA, sub-Saharan African imports of maize totalled 2.9m. tons, which was significantly lower than the century’s peak of 5.2m. tons seven years earlier. Apart from in Egypt, most maize in Africa is grown south of the Sahara. Maize is not grown under irrigation in most of sub-Saharan Africa, as scarce water supplies are reserved instead for export crops with a higher value. Yields are therefore low. In many countries in the region commercial farming is hindered by the lack of foreign exchange to buy essential equipment, as well as fuels and fertilizers. In addition, transport difficulties make marketing expensive and uncertain. In much of Africa maize is a subsistence crop.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.272">South Africa, which grows both white corn (for human consumption) and yellow corn (for animal feed), is traditionally the region’s largest producer. It was formerly an exporter of both types (except in years of severe drought), but market deregulation in 1997 altered the economic basis of commercial maize production. In the absence of government support, domestic maize is not competitive with imported maize in the feed mills of the coastal regions, with the result that sowings, particularly of yellow corn, have fallen. White corn production usually exceeds local food requirements, the surplus being exported to neighbouring food-deficit countries. South African production increased by almost 80% in 2008 (wiping out the bulk of imports). Southern Africa in general suffered from some years of drought in the 2010s, which affected maize harvests in South Africa, but they were showing signs of recovery by 2016/17 when output rose to 17.6m. metric tons, from just 8.2m. tons the previous year. Output fell in the next two years but recovered in 2019/20–2022/23 to reach 17.0m. tons in the latter year. South African maize exports averaged above 2m. tons per year in the 2010s, but from 2014/15 fell to less than 1m. tons, only to recover to 2.3m. tons in 2016/17. In 2022/23 exports reached an estimated 3.8m. tons. Imports increased from negligible levels to 2.2m. tons in 2015/16 and then declined once again in 2016/17–2017/18; it was estimated that South Africa imported almost no maize at all in 2019/20–2022/23. In Zimbabwe maize is the main staple food. The country’s maize crop, like that of South Africa, is often affected by drought. Traditionally, after good harvests Zimbabwe was able to export its surplus of maize. In 2000 the country still exported 107,000 tons of maize, mainly to other sub-Saharan countries, but thereafter, however, Zimbabwe’s agricultural sector was severely disrupted by the deteriorating economic, social and political situation in the country. Exports ceased, and imports were necessary to sustain supplies in most years after 2001. However, Zimbabwean maize output by 2022/23 had recovered to 1.5m. tons, although this represented a decline of almost 50% compared with the previous year, with imports increasing as a result to 200,000 tons in the same year. Zambia (which in 2022/23 exported 1m. tons), Tanzania and Malawi are more consistent in producing surplus production for export. Maize is also Kenya’s main food crop. Output is erratic, depending strongly on weather conditions, and tends to conform to a `boom-and-bust’ pattern. Imports are required in most seasons, especially when, as in recent years, the subsistence needs of refugee camps add to domestic food requirements. Maize is one of Nigeria’s main subsistence crops, and is traded locally—mainly outside the official market economy. In the past, an important end use of maize in Nigeria was for brewing of beer, but since a ban on imports of barley and barley malt was revoked in 1998 breweries have used less maize. Nigerian production rose steadily from the beginning of the 2000s, to peak at 7.1m. tons in 2006 (FAO), eclipsing South Africa, which had had a poor harvest, as the region’s major producer in that year. Generally, it remained the region’s second producer, but the potential for output growth had been hindered by marketing difficulties and shortages of essential agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers, but newly introduced maize varieties helped improve yields. Ethiopia, Ghana and Mozambique are all important producers, mainly for domestic markets.</p>

               <b>Global Forum</b>
       The International Grains Council (IGC) is based in London, United Kingdom. The new Grains Trade Convention entered into force in July 1995, giving what used to be the International Wheat Council a wider mandate to consider all coarse grains as well as wheat (rice was added to the definition of grains from 1 July 2009 and oilseeds from 1 July 2013). In August 2023 the IGC consisted of 28 members and the EU.

               <b>Prices</b>
       Export prices of maize are mainly influenced by the level of supplies and demand in the USA, and the intensity of competition between the exporting countries. The price of US No. 2 Yellow Corn (f.o.b. Gulf ports) first rose above US&#160;$200 per metric ton in January 2008, but global recession pushed it below that mark again from October until September 2010 (in terms of average monthly prices). Prices then rose sharply for a time, reaching above $300 per ton in April–August 2011 and again in July 2012–March 2013, only to dip below $200 per ton for three months from November to February 2014 and to remain below that level from July 2014. Indeed, prices remained below $180 per ton thereafter, tending generally downwards and reaching a low point in September 2017. The average monthly price fell in the second half of 2018, but recovered in early 2019, before falling again for the remainder of 2019 and much of 2020. The price rose thereafter, reaching an eight-year high in May 2021, and rising rapidly again thereafter. By April 2022 the price was averaging $348.17 per ton, the highest monthly level in history, and largely a result of the Russian Federation’s renewed armed invasion and effective blockade of Ukrainian ports (preventing grain exports) in that year. Prices began to decline in late 2022 following a UN-backed agreement, brokered by Türkiye between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, to allow the resumption of grain exports from Ukrainian Black Sea ports. By August 2023 the price had fallen to $207.61 per ton. However, in the previous month it was reported that Russia had withdrawn from the agreement, prompting renewed fears of dramatic price increases that might jeopardize global food security.

          <p>Maize and grain prices were also generally projected to increase in line with the expanding market for ethanol, which is closely linked to the price of petroleum. New energy legislation in 2007, in both the EU and the USA, stipulated the greater use of biofuels for motor vehicles. According to the World Bank, the share of global maize production used for ethanol increased from 2.5% in 2000 to 11.0% in 2007, and the trend remained evident thereafter. However, maize-based ethanol production was still a heavily subsidized industry in the USA, and it remained a costly and relatively inefficient substitute for its sugar-based equivalent (see below). Critics remained sceptical regarding the long-term prospects for the industry, especially as sugar-based ethanol was already being produced more cheaply in Latin America.</p>

          <p id="ASS.MC.282">Manganese is a silvery grey metal that is obtained from various ores containing such minerals as hausmannite, manganite and pyrolusite. The ore is usually washed or hand sorted and then smelted with iron and carbon to make ferromanganese (80% manganese), in which form it is chiefly used to alloy into steel, manganese steel being particularly hard and tough. The other main manganese alloy is silicomanganese (68% manganese). Almost 95% of manganese produced is thus used in the manufacture of steel, which, on average, consumes about 6&#160;kg of manganese per metric ton. Electrolytic manganese is used to make stainless steel and in the aluminium industry. Minor uses of manganese as oxides are in dry cell batteries, paints and varnishes, and in ceramics and glass making. Manganese is the world’s fourth most consumed metal by weight.</p>
          <p>Extensive accumulations of manganese in marine environments have been identified. The characteristic occurrences are as nodules on deep ocean floors and as crusts on sea mounts at shallower depths. Both forms are oxidic and are often termed `ferromanganese’ because they generally contain iron and manganese. The main commercial interest in both types of deposit derives from the copper, nickel and cobalt contents also present, which represent large resources of these metals. Attention was focused initially on nodules, of which the Pacific Ocean encompasses the areas with the densest coverage and highest concentration of potentially economic metals. However, the exploitation of nodules has, to date, been impeded by legal, technical and economic factors.</p>

There is an annual review, found under All Publications/Annual Reviews, which has a chapter reviewing the industry in the previous year. (Unfortunately stats for alloys are behind a paywall now, and the 2021 Annual Review requires a login GV Aug 2022.) There is also a slightly more dated, but detailed socioeconomic assessment (a new one was not available in 2017). Could not find an update for the trade sentence. Reserves come from USGS Summary, country bits from the USGS country surveys (note that it sometimes looks like there is nothing recent, but that is because it used to be grouped with other countries, so check down the list in case recent ones are more focused). For trade figures, if not in Europa, try searching for World Bank WITS trade plus country name, or for trade profile in atlas.media.mit.edu; they usually provide leading commodity exports.

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       According to the International Manganese Institute, in 2020 the manganese industry experienced a considerable contraction: manganese ore production worldwide totalled 20m. metric tons in that year (down 7% compared to 2019); manganese content is usually a little over 30% of the total. Of total 2020 world production of manganese alloys, some 77% was accounted for by silicomanganese, 18% by high carbon ferromanganese and the rest (6%) by refined ferromanganese. In 2022 42m. tons of manganese ore entered international trade, China alone accounting for 71% of world imports. In that year South Africa, Ghana, Gabon and Brazil together accounted for 90% of the supply of manganese ore on the international market. India is no longer a significant exporter.
    </p>
          <p>In 2022 world reserves of manganese were estimated by the USGS at 1,700m. metric tons, of which about 38% were located in South Africa, 16% in China, 16% in each of Brazil and Australia and 8% in Ukraine. About 74% of the world’s identified manganese resources were in South Africa. Development of manganese resources generally and of the Kalahari Manganese Field (KMF) from the 2000s was dominated by two established companies, Assmang and Samancor, and Kalahari Resources. Transport infrastructure was to be expanded in anticipation of the increased production from the KMF that new exploration was expected to generate. The Government also attempted to promote greater local beneficiation of ore into value added products—South Africa’s traditional policy has been to maximize export revenues by shipping as much manganese as possible in processed ferro-alloy form. The country is sub-Saharan Africa’s only producer of manganese alloys, with the 2021 output of the country’s electric furnaces amounting to 102,000 tons in gross weight of ferromanganese (2% of world production) and 151,000 tons of silicomanganese (1%). Output of high-carbon ferromanganese fell further in 2021.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.283">Gabon, Africa’s second major producer of manganese ore, had estimated reserves totalling 61m. metric tons in 2022 (compared with South Africa’s 640m. tons). Gabon’s Moanda mine is operated by Compagnie Minière de l’Ogooué (Comilog), a subsidiary of France’s Eramet SA. All exports reportedly pass through Owendo Port, near Libreville. However, increases in production from Moanda were limited by the capacity of the railway link to the coast, which Eramet was committed to upgrading. According to the USGS, a seven-year modernization programme was underway in 2018. Chinese companies were also hoping to exploit manganese near Ndjole, while other operators also joined the Gabonese market in the 2010s. Exports of manganese ores and concentrates (including ferruginous manganese ores and concentrates) contributed 23% of Gabon’s total export revenue in 2022, compared with crude petroleum on 62% (the country’s timber resources used to earn more than manganese). Plans exist to produce ferromanganese in Gabon, but electricity production is inadequate to achieve this aim. Manganese nevertheless directly accounted for about 6% of Gabonese gross domestic product (2013 figure).</p>
          <p>Ghana benefited from government measures to revive manganese operations in the 2010s, assisted by loan finance from the World Bank. In 2017 Ghana Manganese came into Chinese ownership when TMI (Ningxia Tianyuan Manganese Industry Co) bought it. China has traditionally purchased exports of manganese carbonate ore from Ghana, but Chinese demand for manganese metal increased into the 2010s. Burkina Faso has deposits of manganese ore sufficient to establish it as a minor regional producer. In 2020 it produced about 13,000 metric tons of manganese (metal content) and granted the rights to develop the rich reserves at Tambao to Romanian investors. However, in the following year its output was reported to be negligible. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), once a significant source of manganese exports, has mined only on a sporadic basis since 1980. In Côte d’Ivoire, a new mine operated by Taurian Resources began production in 2007 (the country produced 362,000 tons in 2021), but a mine opened in Zambia in March of the same year was closed by the Government in May for environmental and safety reasons. The USGS reported that the country produced 62,000 metric tons in 2021. A new mine planned in Cameroon, according to the USGS, was delayed as a result of global economic conditions after 2008.</p>

Figures for the production of the individual grains should be treated only as broad estimates in most cases. Data cover only crops harvested for grain.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.295">
      Data on millet relate mainly to the following: cat-tail millet (
      <i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>
       or 
      <i>P. typhoides</i>
      ), also known as bulrush millet, pearl millet or, in India and Pakistan, as `bajra’; finger millet (
      <i>Eleusine coracana</i>
      ), known in India as `ragi’; common or bread millet (
      <i>Panicum miliaceum</i>
      ), also called `proso’; foxtail millet (
      <i>Setaria italica</i>
      ), or Italian millet; and barnyard millet (
      <i>Echinochloa crusgalli</i>
      ), also often called Japanese millet.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.300">
      Sorghum statistics refer mainly to the several varieties of 
      <i>Sorghum vulgare</i>
      , known by various names such as great millet, Guinea corn, kafir or kafircorn (
      <i>caffrorum</i>
      ), milo (in the USA and Argentina), feterita, durra, jowar, sorgo or maicillo. Other species included in the table are Sudan grass (
      <i>S. sudanense</i>
      ) and Columbus grass or sorgo negro (
      <i>S. almum</i>
      ). The use of grain sorghum hybrids has resulted in a considerable increase in yields in recent years.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.301">Millet and sorghum are cultivated particularly in semi-arid areas where there is too little rainfall to sustain maize and the temperature is too high for wheat. These two cereals constitute the staple diet of people over large areas of Africa, India, the People’s Republic of China and parts of the former USSR. They are usually consumed as porridge or unleavened bread. Both grains have good nutritional value, but are less palatable than wheat, and tend to be replaced by the latter when circumstances permit. In many African countries sorghum is used to make beer. Sorghum is also produced and used in certain countries in the western hemisphere (particularly Argentina, Mexico and the USA), where it is used mainly as an animal feed, although the high tannin content of some varieties lowers their value as a feed grain.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.303">Millet and sorghum are grown largely for human consumption, but are gradually being replaced by wheat and rice as those cereals become more widely available. Only low-grade sorghum is used for animal feed in Africa, but some is used for starch when maize is in short supply. Apart from food and animal feed requirements, sorghum is used in a number of countries in Asia and Africa for the production of beers and other alcoholic liquors.</p>

               <!--WMR text: most of this blurb depends on the FAO Trade stuff, but this is still stuck at 2016. Sorry. It is a short section, relying mainly on the tables. It does not warrant more effort as millet and sorghum are mainly produced for domestic markets, so it is not really a traded commodity internationally. GIV Sept 2018-->
               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       World trade in sorghum ranges between 5m. and 10m. metric tons per year, but since the mid-2000s had tended to be closer to the lower end of this range, reflecting the small volume of exportable supplies (until 2021, when total exports of sorghum reached 10.9m. tons). The principal exporter is usually the USA, which in recent decades has, on average, accounted for more than four-fifths of total world exports and holds the greater part of world sorghum stocks. In 2012, however, export volumes had fallen by more than two-fifths; in 2020, however, the USA’s exports almost tripled, and in 2021 they grew again, to account for 61% of world exports, while the other major exporter in that year, Argentina, provided 19% of the sorghum on the international market (representing close to a fivefold increase on the previous year). Australia, traditionally an important exporter, accounted for 14% of world exports in 2021—which was more than eight times its level in 2020. Japan and Kenya were two of the main sorghum markets (buying, respectively, 3% and 2% of world imports) in 2021. However, the People’s Republic of China was the principal importer of sorghum, accounting for 85% of world imports in the same year. Mexico’s annual sorghum purchases tended to average more than 2m. tons annually in the 2000s, less into the 2010s (and only 66,186 tons in 2021—around 11 times less than the 2019 level), but they vary as they depend upon the size of the domestic crop and on the relative prices of sorghum and maize. Imports of sorghum by sub-Saharan Africa were about 0.7m. tons in 2021, or 6% of the world total. Very little millet enters world trade (517,796 tons in 2021), worth US&#160;$192m., according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

               <b>Prices</b>
       Export prices for sorghum tend closely to follow those of maize—sorghum is generally slightly cheaper, although for most of the period from 2000 until January 2008 it was a little more expensive (until the spike and then crash in commodity prices). The US sorghum export price of No. 2 Yellow Milo (f.o.b. US Gulf Ports) reached US&#160;$214 per ton in 2008. During the first half of 2008 the average monthly price of sorghum had increased very considerably, from $187 per ton in January to $262 per ton in June. The fall in commodity prices in the second half of the year, particularly in the last quarter, hit sorghum harder than maize. Prices reached another peak in 2011, then tended to fall and in September 2016 the average monthly price was its lowest since mid-2010. Average monthly prices increased gradually in 2017 and early 2018. Prices fluctuated from mid-2018 until mid-2019, but remained steady until the first half of 2020, when the price increased substantially. Prices continued to rise in 2021–22 on the back of extraordinarily high demand in the People’s Republic of China, before softening in the second half of the year. Concerns surrounding the supply of grain and cereals following the Russian Federation’s renewed armed invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and ongoing war in 2023 pushed prices up once more (to $420 per ton in April 2022, the highest level on record to date), but these had fallen back to $278 per ton by August of the following year. Since relatively little millet enters international trade, no reliable export price series can be established.

          <p id="ASS.MC.307">The oil palm is a tree native to West Africa, and grows wild in tropical forests along the coast of that region. The palm fruit is a red colour, about the size of a big plum, and grows in large clusters that can contain hundreds of fruit and usually weighs between 40 kg and 50&#160;kg. The entire fruit is of use commercially; palm oil is made from its pulp, and palm kernel oil from the seed. Palm oil is a versatile product and, because of its very low acid content (4%–5%), it is almost all used in food. It is used in margarine and other edible fats; as a `shortener’ for pastry and biscuits; as an ingredient in ice cream and chocolate; and in the manufacture of soaps and detergents. Palm kernel oil, which is a lauric oil, and so is similar to coconut oil, is also used for making soaps and fats. The sap from the stems of the tree can be used to make palm wine, an intoxicating beverage. Most processing is done near to where the oil palms are harvested, so the production figures cited tend to be for palm oil and for palm kernels, the latter giving an indication of the number of fruit harvested—for every 100&#160;kg of palm fruit bunches, 22&#160;kg of palm oil and 1.6&#160;kg of palm kernel oil can typically be produced.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.308">Palm oil can be produced virtually through the year once the palms have reached oil bearing age, which takes about five years. The palms continue to bear oil for 30 years or more and the yield far exceeds that of any other oil plant, with one&#160;ha of oil palms producing as much oil as six&#160;ha of groundnuts or 10–12&#160;ha of soybeans. However, it is an intensive crop, needing considerable investment and skilled labour.</p>
          <!--TWO tables: I used to use FAO for production and USDA for oil, but it is safer to use USDA for everything (Oilseed, Palm Kernel and Oil, Palm). PSD Online custom queries. USDA clearly uses estimates a lot, often repeating figures each year. That is why I liked to have FAO in there too, but it is just not reliable enough. GWJ Aug 2017-->

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       During the 1980s palm oil accounted for more than 15% of world production of vegetable oils, second only to soybean oil. Largely driven by high levels of demand in Asia, especially in the People’s Republic of China, palm oil production increased considerably, to account for often more than one-third of world vegetable oils (36% in 2022/23, according to the US Department of Agriculture—USDA, compared with 27% soybean oil and 15% rapeseed oil; palm kernel oil accounts for a further 4%). In world markets for vegetable oils, the dominance of palm oil was even more marked: in 2022/23 palm oil accounted for 58% of all exports of vegetable oils globally (palm kernel oil 3%). In that year the equivalent of 64% of palm oil production worldwide entered international markets. The main producers of palm oil are now Asian. Indonesia replaced Malaysia as the world’s leading individual producer in 2005/06, while in the following year Thailand definitively replaced Nigeria in third place; from 2012/13 Colombia even took fourth place from Nigeria. Indonesia and Malaysia likewise dominate export markets, with Guatemala, Papua New Guinea and Colombia following them distantly in 2022/23. In some years Thailand is an important exporter. India, China and the member countries of the European Union (EU) are the chief importers. The principal consumers of palm oil are Indonesia (25% of world domestic consumption in 2022/23) and India (12%), followed by China (8%) and the member countries of the EU (6%).
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.311">In Africa a large proportion of oil palms still grow in wild groves, and the bulk of oil production is for local consumption. In export terms, Africa has since 1980 accounted for less than 3% of world trade in palm oil, and in 2022/23 sub-Saharan African exports comprised 1.8% of the world market. Côte d’Ivoire and Benin were by far the largest African exporters, followed by Djibouti and Kenya. Nigeria had been the world’s leading producer of palm oil until overtaken by Malaysia in 1971. The loss of Nigeria’s market dominance was, in part, a result of civil war and the authorities’ failure to help replace old, unproductive trees (an estimated 70% of production came from smallholders), but remediation policies could not compensate for growing internal consumption. Nigeria’s reliance on imports subsequently grew, and increases in domestic production now tend to be used for import substitution rather than to boost exports. Nigeria is the world’s fifth largest producer of palm oil, but mainly participates in the international trade as an importer. In 2022/23 Nigeria was sub-Saharan Africa’s fourth largest importer. The largest importer was Kenya, on 20% of the region’s total imports, followed by South Africa and Tanzania, on 11% and 10%, respectively. Many of Africa’s largest producers are not significant exporters of palm oil, using it instead in manufacturing, whether for domestic consumption or export at that stage.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.320">Benin is not now a major producer of palm oil, but is an entrepôt for surrounding countries and, therefore, one of Africa’s largest exporters. In Benin, where the oil palm was traditionally a staple crop of the national economy, oil palm plantations and natural palm groves covered some 450,000&#160;ha in the 1990s, but only an estimated 18,000&#160;ha in 2002 (figure from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations—FAO); by 2021 this figure had recovered to an estimated 34,942&#160;ha. Benin was an important exporter of palm oil in the 2010s, but much was the production of neighbouring countries; it accounted for 17% of sub-Saharan African exports in 2022/23, according to USDA. Côte d’Ivoire had become Africa’s principal palm oil producer-exporter in the mid-2000s, but the country certainly no longer attained the rank of fourth largest exporter in the world as it did throughout most of the 1990s. More than one-half of Côte d’Ivoire’s palms were planted in 1965–70 and had passed their peak of productivity by the end of the 1990s. Management and financial difficulties during the 1990s, as well as declining world prices for palm oil, led to the scaling down of a replanting programme. Plans to increase production in the 2000s were interrupted by civil conflict, but in 2022/23 Côte d’Ivoire sold more palm oil (33%) than any other sub-Saharan African country. Other than Benin, Djibouti, Kenya, Ghana, South Africa and Togo were the next largest exporters of palm oil in 2022/23, but in far smaller volumes. Much production among the smaller producers was to satisfy domestic demand, such as the output of Guinea, sub-Saharan Africa’s ninth largest producer in 2022/23, but not an exporter.</p>

               <b>Prices</b>
       Internationally, palm oil is faced with sustained competition from the other major edible oils—soybean, rapeseed and sunflower oils—and these markets are subject to a complex and changing interaction of production, stocks and trade. Two main distinguishing features have traditionally characterized palm oil relative to its competitors: a very high trade-to-production ratio, far greater than that of comparable crops; and the geographical concentration of both production and trade, for both of which Indonesia and Malaysia account for approximately 90%. Palm oil has enjoyed a long-term price advantage over its principal competitor, soybean oil, which has enabled it to achieve a very high degree of market penetration. It is only in the 21st century—since about 1999—that the prices recorded for palm oil have consistently exceeded the long-term trend, reflecting new demand for feedstocks for biodiesel production. Even so, palm oil is the lowest priced vegetable oil, and it is, in the opinion of many market analysts, the most competitive biodiesel feedstock. However, its utilization for this purpose has remained very low compared with, in particular, rapeseed oil, which enjoys a high level of subsidization in the member states of the European Union (EU), where it is the principal biodiesel feedstock. The average import price (c.i.f. Rotterdam) of Malaysian crude palm oil was just US&#160;$600 per metric ton (monthly average) in September 2015, but strengthened through 2016 to peak at $825 per ton in January 2017; the trend was lower for the rest of that year and through 2018. The price reached just $535 per ton in December of that year, its lowest level since October 2006. By the end of 2019 it had only improved marginally, but the price began to improve in the second half of 2020; from February 2021 the average monthly price stayed above $1,000 per ton, peaking at $1,777 per ton in March 2022 (its highest price on record), before falling for the remainder of the year. Prices remained relatively low in the first half of 2023; by August the price was just $861 per metric ton. The usually more volatile average import price (c.i.f. north-west Europe) of Malaysian palm kernel oil was just $735 per ton in August 2015, but it rose and also recorded its highest level to that date in January 2017, at $1,737 per ton, before falling for the rest of that year and through 2018. Prices remained low in 2019, but showed signs of recovery by the end of the year. Prices trended upwards in 2020–21, and in the first half of 2022 (the price reached $2,443 per ton in February—the highest level ever recorded), maintaining the wider trend of vegetable oil inflation, but fell thereafter, and the price averaged just $998 per ton in August 2023.

          <p>Crude oils, from which petroleum fuel is derived, consist essentially of a wide range of hydrocarbon molecules which are separated by distillation in the refining process. Refined oil is treated in different ways to make the different varieties of fuel. More than four-fifths of total world oil supplies are used as fuel for the production of energy in the form of power or heating.</p>
          <p>Petroleum, together with its associated mineral fuel, natural gas, is extracted both from onshore and offshore wells in many areas of the world. The dominant producing region is the Middle East, whose proven reserves in December 2020 accounted for 48.3% of known world deposits of crude petroleum and natural gas liquids. The Middle East accounted for 36.0% of estimated world output in 2022. Africa (including North Africa) contained 16,572m. metric tons of proven reserves (7.2% of the world total) at the end of 2020, and accounted for 8.2% (344,733m. tons) of estimated world production in the following year.</p>
          <p>From storage tanks at the oilfield wellhead, crude petroleum is conveyed, frequently by pumping for long distances through large pipelines, to coastal depots where it is either treated in a refinery or delivered into bulk storage tanks for subsequent shipment for refining overseas. In addition to pipeline transportation of crude petroleum and refined products, natural (petroleum) gas is, in some areas, also transported through networks of pipelines. Crude petroleum varies considerably in colour and viscosity, and these variations are a determinant both of price and of end use after refining.</p>
          <p>The most important of the petroleum products is fuel oil, composed of heavy distillates and residues, which is used to produce heating and power for industrial purposes. Products in the kerosene group have a wide number of applications, ranging from heating fuels to the powering of aviation gas turbine engines. Gasoline (petrol) products fuel internal combustion engines (used mainly in road motor vehicles), and naphtha, a gasoline distillate, is a commercial solvent that can also be processed as a feedstock. Propane and butane, the main liquefied petroleum gases, have a wide range of industrial applications and are also used for domestic heating and cooking.</p>
          <p>Petroleum is the leading raw material in international trade. Worldwide demand for this commodity totalled an estimated 97.3m. barrels per day (b/d) in 2022, an increase of 3.1% compared with the previous year. The world’s `published proven’ reserves of petroleum and natural gas liquids at 31 December 2020 were estimated to total 244,421m. metric tons, equivalent to 1,732,366m. barrels (1 metric ton is equivalent to approximately 7.3 barrels, each of 42 US gallons or 34.97 imperial gallons, i.e. 159 litres).</p>

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       Nigeria’s first petroleum discovery was made in the Niger Delta region in 1956, and exports began in 1958. Production and exports increased steadily until output was disrupted by the outbreak of civil war in 1967. After the end of hostilities in 1970, Nigeria’s petroleum production greatly increased, and it became the country’s major industry. After Libya restricted output in 1973, Nigeria became Africa’s leading petroleum producing country. Being of low sulphur content and high quality, Nigerian petroleum is much in demand on the European market. Nigeria’s proven reserves were estimated to be 4,978m. metric tons at 31 December 2020. The state petroleum enterprise, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corpn (NNPC), operates refinery facilities at Port Harcourt (I and II), Kaduna and Warri. According to industry sources, Nigeria’s crude petroleum refining capacity amounts to some 475,000 b/d (as of 2022)—including the privately operated Ogbele field in Rivers State. However, according to the NNPC, operational capacity at Nigeria’s refineries was less than 15% in 2016, owing to deficient management, and fire and theft, and sabotage, compounded by the frequent unavailability of sufficient supplies of crude after attacks on the country’s oil infrastructure (see below). In fact, by mid-2023, in spite of a US $25,000m., 10-year government rehabilitation project for refineries, production was still less than 30% of their full capacity. However, it was hoped that reliance on fuel imports—hitherto subsidized to keep prices low—would decline following the expected completion of the large 650,000 b/d Dagote refinery, scheduled for the end of 2023. Since an amnesty was declared in late 2009 between militants and the Government—militants exchanged weapons for money and training opportunities—attacks had declined and companies have been able to rebuild infrastructure. Indeed, the rise in overall production in 2010 was attributed to the amnesty. However, it was reported that between January and October 2013 renewed attacks, kidnappings and vandalism at onshore and shallow offshore fields in the Niger Delta were of equal severity to those of 2008–09, when supply disruptions were at record highs. The deteriorating situation was attributed to the country’s ongoing failure to stimulate significant economic development. In fact it was reported that acts of sabotage had increased in 2016. In September of that year a group calling itself the Niger Delta Avengers claimed responsibility for the destruction of a Shell-operated pipeline used for exports in the south of the country. It was reported that for a few months in 2016 production fell by some 700,000 b/d (close to a 30-year low). In mid-2019 Shell reported that in the Niger Delta region alone it had lost around 11,000 b/d to theft from its crude pipelines during 2018 (an increase from the 9,000 b/d loss in 2017). President Muhammadu Buhari had initially responded to such attacks by changing the payment process for amnesty beneficiaries—instead of paying former militant leaders (who were tasked with distributing funds), the scheme was to pay beneficiaries directly. Moreover, disbursements were diminishing, and for a time in 2016 they were halted altogether. (Payments resumed in August, while it was reported in mid-2017 that President Buhari had approved an additional $100m. for the programme, which represented a significant increase compared with the 2016 budget.) In the first half of 2017 calm returned to the Delta and production increased in response to a shift in government policy which saw Vice-President Oluyemi Oluleke Osibajo (deputizing for President Buhari, who was on extended medical leave) visit the region regularly and meet with local community leaders. Over the whole year, output rose by 4.5% compared with 2016. Following three consecutive years of growth, production in 2020 dropped by 12.6%, although falling output in this instance was the result of depressed industrial output globally—a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic—and concomitant lower demand. However, production continued to fall in 2021–22 (by 12.0% in the latter year), a result of poor maintenance and infrastructure inefficiency. As a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Nigeria is supposed to be bound by the production quotas (which remained in place in mid-2023), capping its production (in June 2023) at 1.3m. b/d (down from its production cap of 1.8m. b/d in August 2022), although its production levels remained well below that. Indeed, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the US Department of Energy, production outages and disruptions meant that Angola had in recent years often overtaken Nigeria as the largest producer of crude petroleum in sub-Saharan Africa. During the course of the `OPEC+’ agreement (see below), Nigeria (in common with other members) had frequently exceeded its production quota, and has been accused of tending to classify some of its output as `lease condensate’, which is not subject to the quota restriction. Indeed, at the latest field to come online (the deep-water Engina project in January 2019), it was suggested that the crude was labelled as a condensate—despite its reported characteristics placing it firmly in the medium, sweet categories. 
    </p>
          <p>Nigeria depends on imports to meet national demand for petroleum products; in 2022 imports of petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals (excluding crude) constituted 39% of total imports (by value) in the year. As part of a wider process of reform of the country’s petroleum sector, the Government planned to address the shortcomings of the refining sector through a programme of privatization and by removing subsidies that encouraged producers of crude petroleum to supply foreign refineries at the expense of local ones. It was reported in mid-2012 that then-President Goodluck Jonathan and his Cabinet had approved the Petroleum Industry Bill, which aimed for transparency in the petroleum sector (through the industry `watchdog’ the National Petroleum Regulator) and privatization of the refining sector; the bill also included tax and royalty reforms. However, some international oil companies were concerned that the legislation would undermine the fiscal viability of certain projects. In August 2021 President Buhari finally signed into law the Petroleum Industry Bill (henceforth Petroleum Industry Act—PIA), a month after it had been passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. In line with the objectives of the PIA, in December 2022 the Government announced a new round of bidding for seven offshore blocks in 2023 (the previous bid round had been in 2007). Furthermore, the Nigerian Government passed the Finance Act in January 2020. One likely repercussion of the Act was an increase in the cost of doing business (including for petroleum corporations) in the country. Meanwhile, Buhari had appointed a minister responsible for the petroleum portfolio in late 2015, following the dismissal of a number of the NNPC’s executive directors and the dissolution of its corporate board. In July of the following year Buhari removed the deputy oil minister from his position as managing director of NNPC, a move welcomed by industry analysts as a positive development—although the latter continued to chair the board of directors. In mid-2016 the NNPC announced provisional agreements with Chinese companies to upgrade existing oil and gas infrastructure. The agreements were reported to be worth some US $80,000m. and included pledges to upgrade refineries and build new pipelines. In 2022, of crude oil exports valued at some US $49,871m., most sales came from European markets (including 11% each from the Netherlands and Spain, 6% from France and 5% from Italy), 14% from India, 9% from Indonesia and 7% from the UAE. The largest African customer was Côte d’Ivoire, which purchased some 4% of Nigerian crude petroleum exports. In 2022 the value of exports of crude petroleum accounted for about 79% of the total value of exports. According to projected data published by the IMF, petroleum had been expected to contribute just 39.6% of federal government revenue in 2023 (up from 33.5% in 2021).</p>
          <p>As in many significant petroleum producing nations, equitable distribution of Nigeria’s oil wealth has been negligible, and in spite of the country’s high ranking among the world’s major exporters of petroleum, it was estimated by the World Bank that in 2022 four out of 10 Nigerians were living in poverty. The operations of multinational oil companies—notably Royal Dutch/Shell—in the Niger Delta have increasingly become the focus of local politically and environmentally motivated opposition. This is frequently expressed in acts of sabotage carried out against pipelines and other oil infrastructure, and in the kidnapping of expatriate oil workers in the Delta. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta is prominent among groups that have claimed responsibility for kidnappings and acts of sabotage in recent years. In 2010 the explosion at BP’s Deepwater Horizon petroleum exploration platform in the Gulf of Mexico and the resulting environmental catastrophe there refocused international attention on environmental damage due to oil production/exploration in other locations, including the Niger Delta, where heavy contamination has occurred regularly for 50 years, and where there were, according to the Nigerian National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, more than 2,400 oil spills between 2006 and 2010. In December 2011 Royal Dutch/Shell’s Bonga field experienced its worst spill for a decade, affecting 150 km–200 km of Nigeria’s coastline. It was reported in mid-2021 that Royal Dutch/Shell had agreed to pay communities in southern Nigeria $111m. in compensation relating to oil spills and resulting environmental damage dating back to 1970—although the company continues to deny responsibility, blaming spills on sabotage during the country’s civil war in 1967–70. Earlier in the year a Dutch appeals court had rejected the company’s defence following a 13-year court battle with Nigerian farmers (two claimants had died during the protracted legal process). Corruption allegations were made against Shell in early 2017 relating to the company’s acquisition of rights to an undeveloped oil block (OPL 245), which were awarded to Shell in 2002. Correspondence seized by Dutch investigators appeared to suggest that Shell (and Eni, of Italy) had engaged with a former Nigerian oil minister and businessman who—with his company Malabu—had owned the rights to the block since 1998. Allegations surround a payment of $1,100m., made ostensibly to the Nigerian Government, but part of which Shell acknowledged in April 2017 would be paid directly to Malabu. An Italian court acquitted Eni, Shell and their managers in early 2021. Meanwhile the block remained undeveloped as of mid-2023.</p>
          <p>Angola, which joined OPEC as its 12th member in January 2007, made its first petroleum discovery in 1955 near Luanda. However, Cabinda province has a major offshore deposit, in production since 1968, which now forms the basis of the country’s oil industry. Output from Cabinda was briefly disrupted by the country’s civil war, but has proceeded uninterrupted since 1977 and has risen steadily since 1982. Since the late 1980s production of crude petroleum has risen more than fourfold. The Angolan economy is heavily dependent on the petroleum industry. The African Development Bank estimated that the sector contributed 30% of the country’s GDP in 2017. In 2007–12 a number of deep-water offshore projects were brought into operation, though production has not surpassed 2008 levels—when output reached 93.1m. metric tons. In 2022 Angola obtained 78.6% of its total foreign earnings from crude petroleum. Angola’s proven oil reserves were assessed at 1,050m. metric tons at 31 December 2020. Domestic consumption of crude petroleum has been forecast to increase in coming years, but is at present sufficiently low to allow most of the country’s output to be exported. The vast majority of Angola’s crude export sales in 2022 were made to countries in the Asia-Pacific region—primarily the People’s Republic of China (some 54% of the total value of crude petroleum exports); some 9% and 6% of Angola’s crude oil sales went to India and France, respectively, in the same year. Also in 2022, Chinese imports of Angolan crude were estimated at 3.5m. tons, while India imported some 607,011 tons; US imports of Angolan crude amounted to 27,487 tons in the same year. The Netherlands and Italy were also major customers for Angolan crude. Plans exist to augment the annual capacity of Angola’s refinery at Luanda, which stood at about 65,000 b/d in 2023, although, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the US Department of Energy, it typically operates well below capacity. None the less, the Government was planning to expand capacity to 72,000 b/d (at a cost of some US $235m.). The national oil company, Sociedade Nacional de Combustíveis de Angola (SONANGOL), is constructing a new refinery, SonaRef, at the coastal city of Lobito. The new refinery, with planned daily capacity of 200,000 b/d, will be able to process heavy crudes such as those produced from Angola’s Kuito and Dalia fields. The facility’s construction was continuing in 2016, until August, when building work was suspended to reassess the project. None the less, the project was scheduled for completion by 2025. Meanwhile, it was reported in mid-2022 that the US-led Quanten Consortium had committed $3,500m. to the Soyo oil refinery project in Zaire province. This refinery—with capacity of 100,000 b/d—is also expected to be completed by 2025. Construction of the Malongo refinery—which will enable Angola to refine its domestic crude—began in September 2020 and was expected to be completed in 2024. Meanwhile, under presidential decree, in mid-2016 President José Eduardo dos Santos had appointed his daughter, Isabel dos Santos, as head of SONANGOL—following his dismissal of the entire board of directors in April of that year. (Following President dos Santos’s decision not to seek re-election in August 2017, however, his successor as President, João Lourenço, removed her from the SONANGOL post in November of the same year, replacing her with Carlos Saturnino—who was then himself fired in May 2019 in response to fuel shortages, and was replaced by Gaspar Martins.) In January 2020 Isabel dos Santos was reported to be under investigation for possible involvement in allegations of corporate mismanagement and misappropriation of funds during her time as head of the state oil company. It was reported in mid-2021 that dos Santos had been ordered by the International Court of Arbitration in the Netherlands to return to SONANGOL her 6% stake (some $500m. in shares) in Portuguese oil company Galp due to alleged illegality in its initial acquisition. Despite historically low prices for crude, between 2015 and 2017 SONANGOL was estimated to have reduced its debt from some $13,600m. to $9,800m. It was reported in mid-2017 that in response to flat oil prices and much needed upstream investment, SONANGOL was undergoing a restructuring; indeed, President Lourenço merged the petroleum and mining ministries soon after his inauguration. The President was also planning the establishment of a regulatory body in 2019—the Agência Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos e Biocombustíveis (ANHB)—to oversee production-sharing agreements with investors and thereby free SONANGOL to focus on commercial activities, but this still required amendments to the Petroleum Activities Law. International oil companies which were reported to be active in Angola’s oil industry in 2010, via joint ventures or production sharing agreements with SONANGOL, included China’s state petroleum company SINOPEC, BP, Chevron, Eni, Total, ExxonMobil, and China National Offshore Oil Corpn (CNOOC). Two projects came online in 2014: Cravo, Lirio, Orquidea and Violeta (CLOV), operated by Total of France and with production capacity of 160,000 b/d, began commercial operations in June; while the West Hub, operated by Eni of Italy and with capacity of 100,000 b/d, came online in December. Angolan fuel prices are among the lowest in the world, a situation attributed to a system of government subsidies, including those related to electricity generation. From 1 January 2016, however, a significant reduction in subsidies resulted in an 80% increase in the price of diesel, and a 39% increase in the price of gasoline.</p>
          <p>Other significant African petroleum producers include Equatorial Guinea, the Republic of Congo, Gabon and Chad. At December 2020 Equatorial Guinea’s proven reserves were assessed at 149m. metric tons; in 2022 it ranked as the seventh largest producer in sub-Saharan Africa. The oil and gas industry regularly contributes more than 90% of the country’s annual GDP, while annual exports of crude petroleum were worth 42% of the total value of exports in 2022. Together with natural gas, petroleum is usually responsible for more than 90% of total government revenue. All of Equatorial Guinea’s production is located offshore. The Republic of the Congo, meanwhile, with proven recoverable reserves estimated at 407m. tons in December 2020, ranked as the third largest producer in sub-Saharan Africa in 2022. In that year Congo’s crude petroleum exports accounted for some 82% of the country’s total foreign export sales (50% more than the previous year). Gabon, whose recoverable reserves were estimated at 274m. tons at 31 December 2020 (the fifth largest reserves in sub-Saharan Africa), earned some 62% of its total foreign income from crude petroleum sales, mostly to China, in 2022.</p>
          <p>
               <b>Sudan and the Secession of the South</b>
       In 1998 Sudan, a relatively minor producer with estimated proven reserves of some 360m. metric tons in that year, finalized an agreement with four foreign companies to construct a 1,600-km pipeline to convey output from western Sudan to a terminal at Bachair, south of Port Sudan. The pipeline, with the capacity to carry 450,000 b/d, was inaugurated in mid-1999, and petroleum production subsequently rose rapidly to total an estimated 23.4m. tons in 2009 and 22.8m. tons in 2010. However, production fell significantly in 2011 and 2012, to just 14.3m. and 5.1m. tons, respectively. Output has remained low in subsequent years, reaching 3.1m. tons in 2022. The decline was largely the result of political and logistical difficulties surrounding South Sudan’s secession from Sudan in 2011. (South Sudan produces most of the area’s petroleum—see below.) Owing to limited resources, the Sudan National Petroleum Corpn (SUDAPET) has frequently collaborated in joint exploration and production ventures with foreign companies, retaining minority stakes in these projects. Among the foreign companies active in Sudan’s oil sector are CNPC, Oil and Natural Gas Corpn of India and Petronas of Malaysia. Activity in the petroleum industry in the south has been complicated by conflicting claims to ownership of resources by northern and southern authorities—NILEPET is South Sudan’s counterpart of SUDAPET. Sudan’s refining facilities are state-owned, with the Khartoum oil refinery (the location of 36m. barrels, or 80%, of national refining capacity) being operated as a joint venture between a Sudanese government vehicle and CNPC. A smaller facility is operated at Port Sudan. In 2015, according to the USGS, Sudan’s petroleum sector contributed 2.0% to the country’s GDP. Meanwhile, the country exported no crude petroleum in 2013 as a result of South Sudan’s secession, which had a devastating effect on its economy. (Exports of crude petroleum subsequently contributed 23% of the total value of the country’s foreign export sales in 2022, with lower production mitigated by significantly higher prices for crude in that year, which meant export receipts were some 54% higher than the previous year.) Sudan’s proven reserves were estimated at 202m. tons at the end of 2020. The manner in which both the production of and exploration for petroleum in Sudan had hitherto been conducted had allegedly involved the Government in human rights abuses, including the forced evacuation of populations living in the vicinity of potentially lucrative oilfields. In late 2006 the US Government had proscribed investment by US individuals and organizations in Sudan’s petroleum and petrochemical industries, a measure that was intended, in part, to counter the alleged use of petroleum derived revenues to fund the conflict in Darfur. Shortly before US President Barack Obama left office in 2017, he signed an executive order temporarily suspending sanctions against Sudan, meaning its petroleum resources could be sold on the global market. The sanctions were due for permanent revocation six months later, but in July of that year US President Donald Trump extended the deadline by three months, by executive order. It was eventually announced in October that a number of the sanctions imposed by the USA had been eased (though some remained in place). In early 2020 it was finally reported that the USA had ended sanctions on 157 Sudanese enterprises. As a result of this development, analysts were optimistic that the sector would now attract foreign investment. To this end, the Sudanese Government had offered up tenders to 15 exploration blocks in November 2017, and a further 10 blocks in March 2019. Following the removal from power of Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir, a Sudanese transitional government, led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, requested the country’s removal from the US list of state terrorist sponsors, a move which would enable renewed access to international financing; in December 2020 the country was formally removed from the list. Following the onset of civil conflict in Sudan in April 2023, there were concerns that crude petroleum production and exports would suffer as a result. However, it was reported in August that crude shipments in May were their highest in almost two years.
    </p>
          <p>At the time of the official declaration of independence of South Sudan from the Republic of Sudan on 9 July 2011, it was unclear how the northern and southern regions would handle the division of petroleum resources: the land-locked southern region produced most (some three-quarters) of the area’s petroleum, but all of the refineries and export pipelines were located in the north, as was the main port. It was estimated by the IMF that petroleum contributed around 76% of total government revenues in South Sudan in 2015–16. At the end of 2011 SUDAPET’s assets in South Sudan were nationalized and transferred to NILEPET. At 31 December 2020 South Sudan’s reserves were estimated at 472m. metric tons. In the following year—the 11th year for which data were available—South Sudan’s petroleum output was estimated to be 6.9m. metric tons, down from 7.5m. tons in 2016. Poor production in 2012 (just 1.5m. tons) was blamed on South Sudan’s imposed halt on output at the end of January 2012. Officials pointed to the high transit fees Sudan was attempting to impose to make up for its lost oil revenue following secession as the reason for South Sudan’s action. (The former was reportedly demanding US $32–$36 per barrel, while South Sudan was offering less than $1 per barrel.) Following more than a year of negotiations, South Sudan restarted production in April 2013, although bilateral arrangements were considered fragile. Considerable disagreement centres around support for rebel groups. The Sudanese Government threatened to cut off access to two main pipelines that export South Sudanese crude from June 2013 in response to South Sudan’s alleged support for rebels accused of plotting to overthrow the administration in Khartoum. In September 2018 and January 2019 South Sudan supported marginal increases in its production by reopening two previously closed fields: Toma South and Unity. South Sudan passed the Petroleum Act in 2012, which established the National Petroleum and Gas Corporation (NPGC)—the country’s main policy-making body responsible for approving oil and gas agreements for the Government. In 2015 the country enacted (though only implemented in part) the Petroleum Revenue Management Act, which is aimed at reducing mismanagement and bribery in the petroleum sector, and encouraging efficient use of revenues in the future. In March 2021 operation of a small refinery in Bentiu, near the international border with Sudan, commenced, while a larger refinery at Thiangrial in the Upper Nile region was under construction in mid-2021. Meanwhile, deliberations were continuing on the construction of a 3,600-km pipeline to Lamu port in Kenya in order to reduce the country’s reliance on Sudan’s pipeline infrastructure—although analysts were not optimistic that it would be built in the near future, given the fragile security situation and lack of financing for the project (as of mid-2022). The origin of disputed shipments of crude continued to damage relations between the two countries in early 2012, while a civil war in South Sudan—which began in late 2013 and only ended in early 2020—further threatened already intermittent supply. Following the signing of a power-sharing and ceasefire agreement between the Government and rebels in August 2018 and the formation of a unity government in February 2020, however, South Sudanese officials were hopeful that the potential improvement in the security situation would attract foreign investment in the sector. Indeed, the country launched its first exploration licensing round in 2021, with five licences offered.</p>
          <p>Traditionally, petroleum exports from Sudan and South Sudan have been sold almost exclusively to Asian markets. However, following the shutdown in South Sudanese production in 2012 (see above), the contribution to Chinese imports of crude petroleum—China being Sudan and South Sudan’s largest purchaser—fell to just 1% (compared with 5% in 2011). In 2022 94.0% of the value of South Sudan’s exports was derived from crude petroleum, with China purchasing some 56% and Italy 34%. Singapore was the third largest market, purchasing 10%. Exports of crude petroleum totalled some 337,000 b/d in 2011, but this fell significantly after South Sudan’s secession, to just 65,000 b/d in 2012; Sudan and South Sudan exported about 1.5m. tons of crude oil in 2022.</p>
          <p>
               <b>Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)</b>
       International petroleum prices are strongly influenced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), founded in 1960 in Baghdad, Iraq. Its purpose is to co-ordinate the production and marketing policies of those countries with substantial net petroleum exports in order to secure stable and fair prices for producing countries, a regular supply of petroleum for consuming countries and a return on capital for countries and corporations that invest in the industry. OPEC came under scrutiny in the 1970s when Arab countries imposed an oil embargo (in 1973), which led to a steep rise in prices on world markets. The embargo—initiated by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC)—was initiated in response to US involvement in the Yom Kippur War. In the meantime, however, the USA had withdrawn from the Bretton Woods Accord, which led to the floating of the US dollar (and other currencies) and an increase in US dollar reserves. The resultant devaluing of that currency meant that petroleum producing countries were receiving less real income from their exports (since petroleum, at this time, was priced and traded in US dollars). OPEC subsequently released a statement confirming that it would henceforth peg the price of a barrel of oil against the price of gold.
    </p>
          <p>OPEC member countries experienced severe economic setbacks in the mid-1980s as prices dropped substantially (by as much as two-thirds). The overall decline in prices was attributed to an oversupply of petroleum and significantly reduced consumer demand. Prices recovered somewhat in the late 1980s, but only to around one-half of the record levels seen at the start of the decade. Recovery was encouraged by the introduction of a production ceiling and the OPEC reference `basket’ (ORB) for pricing. The 1990s was a comparatively stable decade, although Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and the resultant Gulf War created some volatility in world markets. However, the decade was characterized by general weakness in pricing, with particularly mild winters in the northern hemisphere countries in the late 1990s causing prices to drop to 1986 levels. None the less, crude prices strengthened and then stabilized in the early 2000s, before reaching record levels later in the decade (see below). Following historically low prices for crudes in 2015–16, OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed in late 2016 to reduce output for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2008. Saudi Arabia, which had been most significantly impacted by the low prices, assumed the largest reduction in output, while Russia, the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar also agreed to reduced production quotas. Nigeria and Libya were granted exemptions. The deal (and subsequently the enlarged alliance of countries) is often referred to as `OPEC+’; the deal itself has since been extended multiple times. (Meanwhile, production in the USA increased significantly during the same period, overtaking that of both Saudi Arabia and the Russian Federation.) Production quotas remained in place as of July 2023. In October 2022 reduced production amounting to some 2m. b/d was agreed among the OPEC+ alliance. In April 2023 a further voluntary reduction was announced, bringing the total agreed reduction in production for 2023 to 3.66m. b/d, equivalent to almost 4% of global demand. At another meeting in mid-2023 no further cuts were agreed (although Saudi Arabia did commit to its own, voluntary one-month reduction in supply of 1m. b/d in July, subsequently extended to August, with authorities suggesting it could be extended further); however OPEC+ announced that it would limit production to 40.46m. b/d in 2024. Iran, Libya and Venezuela continued to be exempt from the production quotas. US President Biden’s Administration, meanwhile, continued to disapprove of production cuts in 2023, citing the possible impact on continuing market uncertainty. In June 2020 OPEC production had reached its lowest level in nearly 30 years as members sought to reverse the plummeting prices of crude (a consequence of the global contraction in industrial activity during attempts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic). The strategy of OPEC+ to stockpile supplies during the pandemic, however, resulted in rapid price recovery from May 2021, when their quotas began to increase once again. By May of the following year prices were at an almost 10-year high; indeed the average price of the ORB for 2022 was its highest since 2013.</p>
          <p>OPEC distinguishes between founder members and full members. At mid-2023 it had 13 members in total. Nigeria joined OPEC in 1971; the other African members are Algeria, Angola, the Republic of Congo, Gabon and Libya. (Gabon terminated its membership in 1997, but rejoined in 2016.)</p>
          <p>
               <b>Regional Association</b>
       The (then) four African members of OPEC (Algeria, Gabon, Libya and Nigeria) formed the African Petroleum Producers’ Association (APPA) in 1987. Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, the DRC, the Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Mauritania, South Africa and Sudan subsequently joined the association, in which Tunisia has observer status. Apart from promoting co-operation among regional producers, the APPA, which is based in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo, co-operates with OPEC in stabilizing oil prices.

               <b>Prices</b>
       There was international concern over the volatility of prices in the first half of 2012, as the OPEC reference `basket’ (ORB) moved from US $124 per barrel to less than $90 per barrel, in spite of steady supply levels (including a recovery in Libyan production). The average price of the ORB grew by 1.9% compared with the previous year. Global economic growth decelerated to 3.0%, with the People’s Republic of China alone contributing around one-third. The moderate growth was attributed to the ending of financial assistance packages in many developed economies, and the resulting decline in petroleum demand among OECD countries. However, demand in non-OECD countries remained robust, growing by 1.2m. b/d. In Japan, however, crude petroleum consumption increased by 36% as nuclear power plants remained closed and the country sought an alternative electricity supply. Price growth over the year was attributed to resurgent turmoil in the Middle East and supply disruptions in the North Sea fields. The price of Brent crude in 2012 was 0.2% higher than in 2011, averaging $111.63 for the year. The world economy demonstrated some growth in the first half of 2013, but gathered momentum in the second half. Global economic growth slowed to 2.9% in the year overall, while the fluctuation in petroleum prices witnessed in 2012—causing a great deal of market volatility—was largely avoided. Overall world demand for crude increased in 2013 (by some 1.3m. b/d), aided in OECD countries by optimism in manufacturing and other industrial sectors. Japanese demand, meanwhile, declined during the year as it relied more heavily on natural gas and coal for its energy needs, although this was partly offset by increased naphtha consumption resulting from growth in the petrochemical industry. In 2013 the average price of the ORB declined by 3.3%. Following strong growth early in the year (supported by healthy demand and ongoing maintenance issues in the North Sea), petroleum prices declined in the third quarter, following the publication of poor economic data from the USA and China, the world’s two largest consumers. Ongoing economic problems in the eurozone and record inventories in the USA also exerted downward pressure on prices later in the year. The price of Brent crude averaged $108.62 per barrel in 2013, which represented a fall of 2.7% compared with the previous year. The price of the ORB declined significantly in 2014, by 9.0% compared with 2013. Following minimal movement in the first half of the year, prices declined precipitously from June over concerns of oversupply and subdued growth in demand. Surges in Libyan production appeared to justify such concerns, placing crude stocks at levels higher than they had been for five and a half years, while the drop in demand was also attributed to weaker than expected economic data in China and Europe, and ongoing maintenance to refineries. At the end of the year the ORB price reached its lowest point for more than five years; in fact it lost almost one-half of its value during the course of 2014.
    </p>
          <p>The ORB price continued to fall in early 2015 as a result of oversupply: it reached a six-year low in January of US $44.38 per barrel (the seventh consecutive month of decline), before picking up in February. The price of Brent crude averaged just $52.41 in 2015, which represented a decline of almost 50% compared with the previous year’s average. The average price of the ORB, meanwhile, fell to $49.49. Oversupply (which had persisted for some 18 months) and ongoing concerns about a slowing Chinese economy were identified as contributing to the steep decline in prices, as was the strength of the US dollar over the same period. The price of the ORB fell sharply again at the beginning of 2016 (by some 21%), to just $26.50 per barrel. The price represented its lowest value since September 2003. However, it recovered somewhat in the first half of the year. The significant decline in prices in January was again attributed to a weaker Chinese economy, a reduction in demand owing to lower seasonal heating requirements (a consequence of a milder northern-hemisphere winter), and ongoing global oversupply. Prices were steady in the second half of the year, until December, when the average price of the ORB rose by some 20%—the first time in 18 months that the price had averaged more than $50 per barrel. News of cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to rebalance the market (specifically to remove some 1.8m. b/d from the market) led to the steep rise in prices over the month, though the yearly average for 2016 was still the lowest for 12 years. The global economy was generally strong in 2017, which resulted in higher prices for petroleum; global GDP growth was estimated at 3.7% for the year. Economies in China, the USA and the EU had demonstrated forward momentum and increased demand, however, price growth was slow in the first half of the year, and weakened somewhat in June–July—a temporary trend attributed to oversupply and high inventories among producing countries. Damage sustained in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the second half of the year, however, raised supply concerns and caused a sharp rise in prices. By November the price of the ORB had risen more than 35% since June, to over $60 per barrel.</p>
          <p>From June 2018 the ORB included Congolese Djeno crude in its pricing for the first time, a result of the Republic of Congo’s recent accession to OPEC. The price of the ORB remained historically low in that year, although it grew steadily through most of 2018 (increasing by 33.1% year on year) before recording a sharp drop in the final two months. Global economic growth remained steady at 3.6% (slightly down from 2017), although ongoing trade tensions between the USA and China began to impact the latter country, which witnessed a deceleration in growth to its lowest level since 2008. The price of the ORB reached US $79.39 per barrel in October, an increase attributed to positive market sentiment, which was supported by the voluntary production adjustments by OPEC member countries under the Declaration of Cooperation (global stocks were at their lowest since 2014), and increased global demand—up by some 1.43m. b/d over the year. Prices dropped once more from October, with analysts pointing to the easing of supply disruptions and the expectation of a reduction in demand resulting from weak economic growth forecasts—prompted, in part, by continuing US–China tensions over trade. Moreover, higher-than-expected crude production in the USA in particular led to fears of oversupply, with the average price of the ORB falling to just $56.94 per barrel in December. Global economic growth in 2019 was lower than in the previous two years, which was attributed to a slow-down in global trade—a result of ongoing trade disputes involving the USA—as well as lower growth in emerging markets. India in particular registered GDP growth some 2% lower than a year earlier. Demand for crude petroleum and prices over the year were consequently lower than the previous year. Prices in particular were negatively affected by trade disputes between the USA and China. None the less, price growth in the first half of the year was strong (the ORB reached $70.78 per barrel in April), before concerns over global demand led to considerable declines in the second half of the year (prices reached just $59.62 per barrel in August). As the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the first half of 2020 crude petroleum prices entered a precipitous decline; the average price of the ORB was just $17.66 per barrel in April, its lowest level in almost two decades. The plummeting prices were the result of historically low demand (as much industrial production ground to a halt), oversupply and dire predictions of global economic performance. (It was reported that the world economy shrank by 3.5% over the year.) However, by the end of 2020 the ORB and Brent crude prices had recovered substantially (as many countries relaxed the `lockdown’ measures introduced earlier in the year in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus, and supply cuts among OPEC members and non-members alike began to have an effect), averaging $49.17 per barrel and $50.22 per barrel, respectively, in December. Notwithstanding these gains, the average price for the ORB for the year was its lowest since 2016.</p>
          <p>Prices showed strong growth through most of 2021—with its average year-to-date price in October some 68% higher than one year earlier—on the back of a stronger than expected economic performance by many major economies in the second half of 2020, US supply disruptions resulting from severe winter weather, strong demand in advance of the summer driving season (in the northern hemisphere) and declining stocks in many important consuming countries in 2021. Global economic growth was revised upwards to 5.8%, supporting the price recovery; US, Chinese and Indian growth rates were estimated at 5.7%, 8.1% and 8.3%, respectively. The price of Brent crude increased by some 64% in 2021 to average US $70.95 per barrel for the year, its highest level since 2018. The first half of 2022 was characterized by historically high crude prices, a consequence of the resurgent conflict in Ukraine, and the imposition, in response, by many important consumers (including the USA and the European Union—EU) of sanctions on Russian fuel exports—although this was mitigated to some extent be increased Indian and Chinese imports. By June the average price for the ORB was $117.72 per barrel, its highest level since 2013. The price of Brent crude averaged $117.50 over the same month. The average price of the ORB subsequently fell in each month from July amid geopolitical concerns, renewed COVID-19 impacts in China, a well-supplied market and high inflation. Brent crude averaged $99.04 per barrel, which still represented an increase of almost 40% compared with 2021. The average price of the ORB began to recover in January 2023 as China ended its COVID-19 containment policy (supporting an increase in industrial activity and leading to strong demand from Chinese buyers). However, high supply in the USA and Northwest Europe towards the middle of the year pushed prices lower, causing a further round of OPEC+ production cuts in April (see above). By July the average prices for the ORB and Brent crude were $87.33 per barrel and $85.10 per barrel, respectively. In December 2022 and February 2023, meanwhile, the EU had banned maritime imports of all crude and refined petroleum products, respectively, from Russia in retaliation for its renewed military invasion of Ukraine. Higher prices by August, however, suggested that OPEC+ supply cuts, rather than the EU’s ban on Russian imports, were the principal cause of the upward trend. Indeed, according to International Energy Agency (IEA) data, in May 2023 India and China received some 80% of all Russian petroleum exports in that month, with some 90% of Russian seaborne crude petroleum destined for Asia (compared with just 34% before the renewed conflict with Ukraine)—statistics that appeared to suggest that demand in that region had effectively replaced demand in Europe.</p>

          <p id="ASS.MC.366">Platinum is one of a group of six related metals known as the platinum-group metals (PGM), which also includes palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium. In nature, platinum is usually associated with the sulphides of iron, copper and nickel. Depending on the relative concentration of the PGM and copper and nickel in the deposit, platinum is either the major product or a by-product of base metal production. PGM are highly resistant to corrosion, and do not oxidize in air. They are also extremely malleable and have a high melting point, giving them a wide range of industrial uses. Platinum itself is grey-white in colour and popular for jewellery. Alloyed platinum is hard and heavy, and it is the least chemically reactive of the metals. As with gold, platinum’s traditional units are troy ounces (oz), but production figures are given in kilograms; 1 oz is equivalent to 31.103 g, and there are 32,151 oz in 1 metric ton.</p>

          <p id="ASS.MC.367">
               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       Although widely employed in the petroleum refining and petrochemical sectors, the principal industrial use for platinum is in catalytic converters in motor vehicles (which reduce pollution from exhaust emissions), which, from 2004, generally accounted for almost one-half of global platinum consumption (down to 40% in 2018, given the challenge of palladium as an alternative). Since the 1990s most Western countries and many others have implemented legislation to neutralize vehicle exhaust gases, and this necessitates the fitting of catalytic converters, using platinum, rhodium and palladium, to vehicles. The resultant increase in demand for automotive emission control catalysts (autocatalysts) generated a rising trend in the consumption of platinum, rhodium and palladium during and since the 1990s, in particular as further restrictions on emissions were introduced. The increasing use of autocatalysts, principally by US and European motor vehicle manufacturers, was reflected in a strong advance in autocatalyst demand for platinum into the 2000s. Almost one-half of platinum use in autocatalysts was once accounted for by Europe, but that proportion is declining. Palladium use in autocatalysts (80% of palladium consumption in 2018) was increasing more rapidly than that of platinum, in particular in North America, while in the longer term new technologies in motor vehicles threatened the need for autocatalysts. Platinum is also a precious metal and some is traded as bullion, but it is rather more popular in jewellery (27% of platinum consumption in 2018). Until the growth in demand for autocatalysts, Japan was the world’s main consumer of platinum, its jewellery industry absorbing 19% of total global demand in 1999. However, Japanese demand for platinum jewellery fell steadily through the 2000s and, from 2001, Chinese jewellery demand was a challenger, in some years exceeding European autocatalyst demand.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.369">World production of PGM generally is dominated by South Africa, which traditionally accounted for about three-quarters of supplies of platinum—the proportion has declined in the 2000s. More accurate assessment of global production has been possible since 2005, when official data relating to Russian PGM were declassified. The Russian Federation is the world’s largest producer of mined palladium (except in 2015, when South African output exceeded that of Russia) and the second largest producer of platinum. Canada was once the third largest producer of platinum, mined as a by-product of nickel production, but in 2009 was displaced by Zimbabwe. The next largest platinum producer was the USA. According to industry sources, the world’s five leading platinum mining companies in 2022 were Anglo American Platinum Ltd (Amplats) of South Africa, Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd (Implats) of South Africa, Sibanye-Stillwater of South Africa, OJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel of Russia and Northam Platinum of South Africa. The South African industry has been affected in the 2010s by labour unrest (including strike action in 2014, which lowered output for the year), greater enforcement of safety standards in mines, possible ownership legislation and power supply issues. In 2022 South Africa’s exports (f.o.b.) of platinum (unwrought, powder, or semi-manufactured) contributed 13.5% of the country’s total export earnings. It was reported in mid-2023 that Amplats headline earnings had fallen by 71% in the first six months of the year compared with the first half of 2022, as a result of weaker prices for PGM and production challenges , partly owing to electricity disruptions in South Africa—the national power utility continued its significant rotational power rationing (`loadshedding’) throughout the country in the first half of the year. Moreover, refined production of PGM had also declined (by 13%) in the first six months of 2023.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.371">Zimbabwe, the only other significant African producer, boasts sizeable deposits of PGM. In 2017 an implementation of the 2008 `indigenization’ legislation (proposing the transfer of 51% of all foreign owned companies in the country to Zimbabwe nationals) seemed to have been agreed. (The Government of new Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, elected in July 2018, subsequently indicated that the 51% local stakeholder stipulation would indeed apply to the gold and platinum industries.) Negotiations about the compliance details gazetted in 2011 dragged on for some years, though by 2013 all three companies involved had allocated equity to local community, employee and national trusts. The Government favoured a greater degree of domestic beneficiation of PGM ores and, in April 2017, agreed the construction of a smelter in the country (apparently using the new Kell process, which is considered cheaper) with Pallinghurst Resources (since renamed Gemfields) of the UK. To avoid the risks of a perceived `asset grab’ against the major multinational companies, the indigenization obligation would be satisfied by having to supply the ore to the new refinery; Amplats later reported that it would be excused the requirement to supply the government smelter because it was already building its own (since completed in 2019). Notwithstanding the devastating economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was reported in mid-2020 that the largest mining company in Zimbabwe (Zimplats—the Zimbabwean offshoot of Implats) had posted a 38% increase in revenue for the year ending 30 June 2020. However, revenue in the first half of 2023 was down 23% compared with the first half of 2022, owing to lower demand for PGM end products (and consequently lower prices). It was reported in early 2022 that Implats would be investing close to US&#160;$80m. in the Bimha mine, following the recent completion of a $100m. reconstruction project at the mine (which had collapsed in 2014). Meanwhile, the power issue in southern Africa remained problematic. PGM occur as trace element by-products associated with nickel production in Botswana, but the country produces more palladium than platinum. Elsewhere in Africa, there are known or probable deposits of platinum in Ethiopia, Kenya and Sierra Leone.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.372">Whereas PGM are produced in Canada and Russia as by-products of copper and/or nickel mining, PGM in South Africa are produced as the primary products, with nickel and copper as by-products. Another fundamental difference between the platinum deposits in South Africa and those in Russia and Canada is the ratio of platinum to palladium. In South Africa the percentage of platinum contained in PGM has, to date, exceeded that of palladium, although the ratio tended to favour palladium in new mines that were brought into production from the early 1990s (see below). In the Russian Federation, Canada and the USA there is a higher proportion of palladium than platinum.</p>

               <b>Prices</b>
       International commodity prices for platinum (and palladium) are based on the afternoon `fix’ on the London Platinum and Palladium Market (LPPM) or, from 1 December 2014, on the London Bullion Market in the UK, cited in US dollars per troy oz. A twice-daily quotation of platinum prices began in London in 1973 (the main London and Zurich, Switzerland, dealers agreeing certain common standards in 1979), but the system was only formalized as the LPPM in 1987, with quotations upgraded to full fixings in 1989. In that year the nominal London platinum price was US&#160;$507.3 per oz, a level that was not exceeded until 2000 (in real terms, the 1989 price was not exceeded until 2004, but subsequently rose to a new peak in 2011). The average annual London platinum price, together with the highest and lowest average monthly prices in each year, are cited in the table (above), along with the corresponding London palladium price (also based on the afternoon `fix’ and given in US dollars per troy oz). Both platinum and palladium are industrial metals, but platinum in particular is a precious metal and can be an investment resource.

          <!--This appears again in FEA, so copy it there. FAO not updated (again) so I have changed to USDA entirely - might be more reliable. You will need both the WMPTR (Grains) and the PSD Online database. The Grains report is monthly, so it is good if you can use the August one, but for Africa you usually only need it for Imports; otherwise rely on PSD Online. Table: USDA figures are for production of milled rice, not paddy rice as for FAO (NB. FAO will cover paddy rice production figures for smaller producers). WMR text: trade as a proportion of production can be checked from USDA figures, just in case it goes above 10% or below 5% or something. Export and import figures, including the country-specific stuff, come from USDA, while the smaller countries that it does not cover can be found in FAO. Regional Research Organization: update members from the AfricaRice website. Prices: use the Pink Sheet data. GWJ Aug 2017-->
          <p id="ASS.MC.392">Rice is an annual grass belonging to the same family as (and having many similar characteristics to) small grains such as wheat, oats, rye and barley. It is principally the semi-aquatic nature of rice that distinguishes it from other grain species, and this is an important factor in determining its place of origin. In Africa and Asia unmilled rice is referred to as `paddy’, although `rough’ rice is the common appellation in the West. After removal of the outer husk, it is called `brown’ rice. After the grain is milled to varying degrees to remove the bran layers, it is called `milled’ rice. Since rice loses 30%–40% of its weight in the milling process, most rice is traded in the milled form to save shipping expenses.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.393">
      There are two cultivated species of rice, 
      <i>Oryza sativa</i>
       and 
      <i>O. glaberrima</i>
      . Originating in tropical Asia, 
      <i>O. sativa</i>
       is widely grown in tropical and semi-tropical areas, while the cultivation of the native 
      <i>O. glaberrima</i>
       is limited to the high rainfall zone of West Africa. In Africa rice is grown mainly as a subsistence crop, principally by smallholder farmers of whom a disproportionate number are women. Methods of cultivation differ from region to region and yields tend to be low by world standards. Rice is a staple food in several African countries, including Côte d’Ivoire, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Madagascar, Senegal and Sierra Leone. In West African countries generally rice is a staple food of 40% of the population. As a consequence of population growth and increased dietary preference for rice, sub-Saharan African demand for consumption increased rapidly in the late 20th century. Most of the varieties of rice cultivated in Africa originated in Asia and are relatively new to the region, so suitable high-yielding varieties only began to be propagated from the 1990s (see below).

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       The bulk of rice production is consumed in the producing countries, and international trade generally accounts for less than 10% of world output. Governments are the principal (but not exclusive) traders, and four countries dominate the export market in most years: Thailand, Viet Nam, the USA and India. Thailand became the world’s leading rice exporter in 1981, and rice has remained the country’s principal agricultural export commodity. Thailand’s dominance in the world rice market has come under increasing pressure, although it still provided some 8.5m. metric tons of milled rice to world markets in 2022/23 (15% of global exports, according to provisional figures from the US Department of Agriculture—USDA); a controversial subsidy introduced in 2011 (known as the rice pledging scheme) left the country with fewer exports and high stocks, without any increase in the export price, because India (ending a non-basmati rice export ban in the same year) and Viet Nam supplied the balance to world markets. By selling stocks at aggressive prices, Thailand briefly regained its position as the leading rice exporter in 2013/14, but India was then again ahead, as it had been for some years. In 2022/23 USDA put Indian exports at 22.5m. tons or 40% of the milled rice market and Viet Nam’s share at 13%; Pakistan was the next largest exporter, at 7%, then the USA (4%), followed by Myanmar, Cambodia and the People’s Republic of China (3% each). The role of China in international rice markets changed significantly in the early 21st century. In 2000 it was the third largest rice exporter (supplying 13% of world trade), but it experienced a period of being far less significant in global markets in the latter part of the first decade of the century as it largely satisfied its own needs. In the 2010s, however, China’s policy of support for the price of domestic rice not only encouraged high levels of production, but the importation of cheaper foreign rice. Rice exports remained healthy, but the country became not only a net importer of rice, but the world’s largest importer. In 2022/23 China accounted for almost 8% of global purchases—up from the 5% three years earlier. The second largest importer in that year was the Philippines (7%), followed by Nigeria (4%).
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.397">World rice production is therefore dominated by the Asian region (East, South and South-East Asia produced 90% of the world’s total in 2022/23). African rice production increased steadily from the 1970s, but increased dependence on imports resulted in a reduction in domestic production (although this began to recover in the 2000s). Sub-Saharan African output accounted for only some 4.1% of total world output in 2022/23 (compared with 7.2% of global domestic consumption). As the bulk of rice production is consumed mainly in the producing countries, the market is subject to great volatility and fluctuating prices. Only 2% of the sub-Saharan African rice crop entered international trade in 2022/23—few African countries export much rice, apart from Egypt, which is the continent’s largest producer. Sub-Saharan Africa is a substantial net importer of rice, although the volume growth in imports was held in check by the impact of higher world rice prices on the depleted foreign exchange reserves of many African importing countries: sub-Saharan Africa bought 31% of global imports in 2022/23, according to USDA. The major African importers include Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal and South Africa. In 2022/23 Nigeria was (together with Iraq) the world’s third largest importer, accounting for 2.1m. tons or 4% of the total in international trade. Madagascar, the world’s largest consumer of rice in per caput terms, has not yet achieved its goal of self-sufficiency in rice, although steadily improving harvests from 2002/03 put this aim within reach. The country began to challenge Nigeria for its position as sub-Saharan Africa’s largest rice producer from the mid-2000s.</p>

               <b>Regional Research Organization</b>
       The development of HYV counts among the activities of the Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice), formed by the producing countries in 1971 as the West Africa Rice Development Association (WARDA, which acronym it retained until 2009). The grouping had 28 members in 2023. From the beginning of 2005 the organization transferred its operations to Cotonou, Benin, from its headquarters in Bouaké, Côte d’Ivoire, owing to ongoing political instability in the latter country, but in 2015 announced that it would begin a phased return of its headquarters and activities to Côte d’Ivoire during that year. Research staff are based in Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Senegal and Tanzania, conducting scientific research on crop improvement and providing technical assistance, with the aim of advancing the region towards eventual self-sufficiency in rice production. Since 2000 several New Rice for Africa (NERICA) cultivation projects have been initiated. The NERICA varieties have been developed by what is now AfricaRice, and it is hoped that their adaptation to West African growing conditions will increase their yields by at least 25%, compared with conventional rice crops. The next stage, in the following decade, was the introduction of the Advanced Rices for Africa (ARICA).

       Rice was not exempt from the rapid expansion in global commodity prices seen from late 2007 and into the first half of 2008. Market observers placed the extraordinarily high levels to which international prices of rice rose in the first half of 2008 in the context of a rising trend in the prices of basic food commodities—in particular wheat, soya, maize, rape and palm oil—that had been apparent for two years, as supply failed to keep pace with increasing demand for food, given a generally higher standard of living in developing countries, especially in Asia. A high level of speculative investment in agricultural commodities also contributed, because they had come to be viewed as a refuge from rising inflation and the weakness of the US dollar (for a three-month period in the first half of 2008 rice reportedly became the agricultural `market of choice’ for speculative funds). Domestic inflation or the need to placate social unrest also prompted export curbs or other restrictions imposed by some major rice-exporting countries. Such policies—with some countries reducing exports and others increasing imports—are of particular significance because of the small proportion of world rice production that enters world trade. Given such restrictions, notably in India, rice prices remained firm after the general commodity price correction in the second half of 2008. Using the price of Thai milled white rice (5% broken—indicative survey price, government standard, f.o.b. Bangkok) as an indicator, average monthly prices peaked in April 2008 at US&#160;$907 per metric ton (187% higher than one year previously and 141% higher than even at the beginning of the year—the average price for 2008 was $650 per ton). In April–June 2014 and April 2015 for one year average monthly prices fell below $400 per ton (for the first time since January 2008). Prices recovered in late 2017 and were generally higher through 2020–22 (staying above the $400 per metric ton threshold). Prices began to climb again by the end of 2022 and into 2023 as a result of severe supply shortages caused by the war in Ukraine and adverse climatic conditions in China and Pakistan; by August the price had reached $635 per ton.

          <!--Sugar appears in all four regions, so copy it finally to FEA. FAO not updated (again) for sugar cane, but there is also a table from USDA for production of centrifugal sugar. The report you use will be from May, the Sugar WMPTR, and PSD Online database supplements for individual countries. Text: for the stat about beet sugar as a proportion of the world total for centrifugal sugar, use USDA PSD Online; custom query for centrifugal sugar will show not only a Production option but a Beet Sugar Production then do the maths. TWO tables: FAO for sugar cane production, USDA for centrifugal sugar. The beet sugar footnote is from PSD Online, as above for the text (no regional worry here, as no one in Africa produces beet sugar). Check years, because sometimes USDA PSD has 2016 and 2016/17 (usually) but occasionally 2015/16. WMR text: use the Sugar WMPTR to update the text here. For regional imports and exports, etc., use PSD Online. THE WMPTR will list largest exporters, if you want to save going through picking out all African countries to compare. For Reunion I discovered the annual report on it at the Institut d Emissions des Departements d Outre-mer (www.iedom.fr), which mentioned the specific sugar exports percentage in the blurb if not the table. NB. IEDOM will be useful for those French territories in SACAC too, with their dated figures in the narratives. The name appeared as a source in the Reunion stats, so thank you. International Associations and Agreements: big blurb on sugar agreements, etc., but more importantly on the Lom&#233; conventions; the phasing out of the old-style price support will affect a lot of monoculture countries badly in the years to come. For ISO membership, count list under Membership/Our Members. Prices: use the Pink Sheet data. GWJ Aug 2017-->

      Sugar is a sweet crystalline substance which may be derived from the juices of various plants. Chemically, the basis of sugar is sucrose, one of a group of soluble carbohydrates which are important sources of energy in the human diet. It can be obtained from trees, including the maple and certain palms, but virtually all manufactured sugar is derived from two plants, sugar beet (
      <i>Beta vulgaris</i>
      ) and sugar cane, a giant perennial grass of the genus 
      <i>Saccharum</i>
      .
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.414">Sugar cane, found in tropical areas, grows to a height of up to 5&#160;m (16&#160;ft). The plant is native to Polynesia, but its distribution is now widespread. It is not necessary to plant cane every season as, if the root of the plant is left in the ground, it will grow again in the following year. This practice, known as `ratooning’, may be continued for as long as three years, when yields begin to decline. Cane is ready for cutting 12–24 months after planting, depending on local conditions. More than one-half of the world’s sugar cane is still cut by hand, but rising costs are hastening the change to mechanical harvesting. The cane is cut as close as possible to the ground, and the top leaves, which may be used as cattle fodder, are removed.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.415">After cutting, the cane is loaded by hand or by machine into lorries (trucks) or trailers and towed directly to a factory for processing. Sugar cane deteriorates rapidly after it has been cut and should be processed as soon as possible. At the factory the cane passes first through shredding knives or crushing rollers, which break up the hard rind and expose the inner fibre, and then to squeezing rollers, where the crushed cane is subjected to high pressure and sprayed with water. The resulting juice is heated and lime is added for clarification and the removal of impurities. The clean juice is then concentrated in evaporators. This thickened juice is next boiled in steam heated vacuum pans until a mixture or `massecuite’ of sugar crystals and `mother syrup’ is produced. The massecuite is then spun in centrifugal machines to separate the sugar crystals (raw cane sugar) from the residual syrup (cane molasses).</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.416">After the milling of sugar, the cane has dry fibrous remnants known as bagasse, which is usually burned as fuel in sugar mills. Bagasse can also be pulped and used for making fibreboard, particle board and most grades of paper. As the costs of imported wood pulp have risen, cane growing regions have turned increasingly to the manufacture of paper from bagasse. In view of rising energy costs, some countries (such as Cuba) have encouraged the use of bagasse as fuel for electricity production in order to conserve foreign exchange expended on imports of petroleum. Other by-products can be utilized as an animal feed or distilled into alcoholic beverages (notably in Brazil).</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.417">The production of beet sugar follows the same process as sugar from sugar cane, except that the juice is extracted by osmotic diffusion. Its manufacture produces white sugar crystals that do not require further refining. In most producing countries, it is consumed domestically, but any fall in the production of beet sugar by the European Union (EU) can mean that it becomes a net importer of white refined sugar. Beet sugar accounted for about one-fifth of estimated world sugar production (21% in 2022/23), according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The production data in the first table, therefore, is for sugar cane, covering all crops harvested, except crops grown explicitly for feed. The second table covers the production of raw sugar by the centrifugal process (including beet sugar). While global output of non-centrifugal sugar (i.e. produced from sugar cane which has not undergone centrifugation) is not insignificant, it tends to be destined for domestic consumption. The main producer of non-centrifugal sugar is India, where it is known as gur, but countries such as Brazil and Colombia are also significant producers.</p>
          <p>Most of the raw cane sugar produced in the world is sent to refineries outside the country of origin, unless the sugar is for local consumption. Cuba, Thailand, Brazil and India are among the few cane producers that export part of their output as refined sugar. The refining process further purifies the sugar crystals and eventually results in finished products of various grades, such as granulated, icing or castor sugar. The ratio of refined to raw sugar is usually about 0.9:1.</p>
          <p>
      In the closing decades of the 20th century sugar encountered increased competition from other sweeteners, including maize-based products, such as isoglucose (a form of high-fructose corn syrup, or HFCS), and chemical additives, such as saccharine, aspartame (APM) and xylitol. APM was the most widely used high-intensity artificial sweetener in the early 1990s, its market dominance then came under challenge from sucralose, which is about 600 times as sweet as sugar (compared with 200–300 times for other intense sweeteners) and is more resistant to chemical deterioration than APM. In 1998 the US Government approved the domestic marketing of sucralose, the only artificial sweetener made from sugar. Sucralose was stated to avoid many of the taste problems associated with other artificial sweeteners. From the late 1980s research was conducted to formulate means of synthesizing thaumatin, a substance derived from the fruit of the West African katemfe plant, 
      <i>Thaumatococcus daniellii</i>
      , which is about 2,500 times as sweet as sugar. As of 2005, the use of thaumatin had been approved in the EU, Israel and Japan, while in the USA its use as a flavouring agent had been endorsed. By 2011 sugar use was resurgent because of health concerns about other sweeteners—for example, sugar producers attempted to preserve this advantage in the US courts by preventing the Corn Refiners Association from renaming HFCS `corn sugar’.

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       Production of sugar cane is dominated by Latin America and the Caribbean, which usually grows about one-half of the world total: 49% in 2021, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO—South America 43%, Central America 6% and the Caribbean 1%). South Asia grew 28% of the world’s sugar cane, eastern Asia and Oceania—the Far East and Australasia—16% and Africa 5% (sub-Saharan Africa 4%). The area under sugar cane cultivation in the whole of Latin America and the Caribbean more than doubled in the 40 years from the late 1960s, but the Caribbean declined in importance to sugar production, with the area harvested in Central America increasing by 76% and that in South America more than fourfold. Moreover, South America enjoyed productive yields, whereas the Caribbean yield was the lowest in the world. According to USDA, exports of (centrifugal) sugar from Latin American and Caribbean countries contributed 50% of total world sales abroad in 2022/23, compared with 24% from eastern Asia and Oceania, notably Thailand and Australia. Some major Asian producers such as China are net importers; South Asia, likewise, is a net importer, despite India being the second largest producer in the world. The main importing regions were eastern Asia and Oceania (34% in 2022/23, mainly Indonesia and China) and the Middle East and North Africa (23%).

          <p id="ASS.MC.418">In Africa ethanol has been blended with gasoline (petrol) for use in fuel for motor vehicles in Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe, but Zimbabwe is the only one of those countries to have required it, legally, to be used. In 2008 the World Bank estimated that Mozambique, Tanzania and other African countries had large cultivable areas that could be used for sugar cane ethanol production without directly displacing food crop production. By then, however, the promotion of biofuels was becoming increasingly controversial. In April 2008 a report compiled by the World Bank argued that the drive for biofuels by the US and European governments had been the most important factor responsible for the rapid increase in the prices of internationally traded food commodities since 2002. In the same month a UN report warned that unchecked expansion of the production of biofuel jeopardized food security in developing countries, not only by raising food prices, but also by making `substantial demands on the world’s land and water resources at a time when demand for both food and forest products is also rising rapidly’. The UN urged governments to put in place regulations to manage the growth of the biofuel industry.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.429">Sugar cane production in sub-Saharan Africa accounts for only a small share of global output (4.3% in 2021), but the rate of growth in sugar output increased between the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s, in response to an increase in regional sugar consumption, as well as a consequence of national sugar expansion programmes that aimed to boost exports—a number of African sugar producing least developed countries (LDCs) gained duty-&#160;and quota-free access to the EU sugar market from 1 October 2009, under the EBA (Everything But Arms) regulation (see below). According to preliminary figures from USDA, in 2022/23 sub-Saharan Africa’s contribution to world sugar exports was 3.4% of the total. South Africa is usually the continent’s largest exporter, in 2022/23 accounting for 27% of all sub-Saharan African exports of centrifugal sugar (some 635,000 metric tons). However, this volume of exports represented close to one-third of the level achieved just three years earlier, when the country sold 1.5m. tons of sugar abroad (42% of sub-Saharan exports in that year). The next largest regional exporters in 2022/23 were Eswatini selling 545,000 tons and Nigeria 350,000 tons, while Mauritius exported 335,000 tons in that year. Eswatini and other neighbouring countries have provided South Africa with increased competition in its domestic market, because of free trade agreements in the context of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, Togo and Uganda were also important exporters.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.430">Sugar is the staple product in the economies of Mauritius and Réunion, although output is vulnerable to climatic conditions, as both islands are subject to cyclones. In Mauritius, cane and beet sugar sales accounted for about 14% of the island’s revenue from exports in 2022. Increasingly, the island was exporting refined sugar, boosted by a 2010 agreement with the European Union (EU). In Réunion, sales of sugar (together with rum) provided 21% of export income in 2022. The expansion of sugar output, however, was subsequently impeded by unfavourable weather, and by the pressure on agricultural land use from the increasing demands of road construction and housing. Mozambique’s sugar industry, formerly the country’s primary source of foreign exchange, has begun to surmount the ill effects of many years of disruption and neglect. Considerable Mauritian and South African investment following the resolution of internal civil conflict made possible the rehabilitation both of cane growing and of four of the country’s six sugar complexes. Production of raw centrifugal sugar increased rapidly after the conclusion of the peace agreement, rising from 39,000 metric tons in 1998 to about 265,000 tons in 2005, its highest level for 30 years, according to the National Sugar Institute. Increased investment in the second half of the 2000s restored the country as a net exporter. However, in 2022/23 the country exported just 100,000 tons of sugar (less than its imports in that year). South Africa is an important preferential export market, favourable prices being regulated under SACU. In 2022 cane and beet sugar provided 2.5% of Malawi’s revenue from foreign sales (although this was 69% below the level achieved in 2021); the differing fortunes of commodity prices mean the country’s most valuable agricultural export after tobacco varies between sugar, tea and coffee, with groundnuts (peanuts) also beginning to challenge. Zambia and Zimbabwe have also launched rehabilitation and expansion programmes. However, in 2022/23 Zimbabwe exported just 26,000 tons of sugar (almost one-quarter of the level two years earlier).</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.432">Outside southern Africa, Tanzania sought to develop its sugar sector during the 1990s, with the aim of reducing reliance on imports from Malawi and Zambia. Domestic demand for raw sugar outstrips production, but Tanzania usually exports some sugar each year (10,000 metric tons in 2015/16, but none the following seven years) to the EU and had expanded its sugar industry to take advantage of improved EU market access under the EBA regulation. Uganda increased production too during the 2000s, while Ethiopian production was reckoned to be steady, but with rising domestic consumption having put an end to exports in 2007—any fall in production, such as in 2014/15, increased imports. Kenya’s rising output of centrifugal sugar made the country one of sub-Saharan Africa’s largest producers, but a negligible exporter. In Sudan one of the world’s largest single sugar projects was inaugurated in 1981 at Kenana, on the eastern bank of the White Nile, south of Khartoum. The Kenana Sugar Co (in which the governments of Sudan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are the major shareholders), comprising an estate and processing facilities, was instrumental in the elimination of the drain on reserves of foreign exchange of sugar, which was, until the mid-1980s, Sudan’s costliest import item after petroleum. Regeneration of the industry and the construction of a second growing and refining facility in the White Nile region, north of the Kenana site, improved production, but from 2008/09 Sudan was a net importer. Its exports, however, are of refined sugar and remain important. Sudan was sub-Saharan Africa’s fourth largest producer of centrifugal sugar in 2022/23. Sudan has traditionally been the region’s largest exporter of refined sugar; following the secession of South Sudan in mid-2011, with its rich petroleum reserves, the Government had ambitions to expand the sugar sector. In West Africa, the most important sugar producer and exporter is Nigeria, but its interests are in refined sugar. Sugar cane grows wild throughout Nigeria, and domestic production has not been developed, so the country’s sugar industry depends on imports, mainly from Brazil, Guatemala and the EU. In 2005 one sugar refinery was reported to be in operation in Nigeria. The country has a large domestic market. Imports reached 2.0m. tons in 2022/23, according to USDA.</p>

               <b>International Associations and Agreements</b>
       In 1958 the first International Sugar Agreement (ISA) was negotiated. A second ISA, which came into effect in 1969, established the International Sugar Organization (ISO—see below) to administer the agreement. The implementation of a third ISA, which took effect in 1978, was supervised by an International Sugar Council (ISC), which was empowered to establish price ranges for sugar trading and to operate a system of quotas and special sugar stocks. Owing to the reluctance of the USA and of European Communities (EC—now the EU) countries (which were not party to the agreement) to accept export controls, the ISO ultimately lost most of its power to regulate the market, and since 1984 the activities of the organization have been restricted to recording statistics and providing a forum for discussion between producers and consumers. Subsequent ISAs, without effective regulatory powers, have been in operation since 1985. At the end of 1992 the USA withdrew from the ISO, following a disagreement over the formulation of members’ financial contributions. Special arrangements for the sugar trade were incorporated into the successive Lomé Conventions that were in operation from 1975 between the EU and a group of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. A special protocol on sugar, forming part of each Convention, required the EU to import specified quantities of raw sugar annually from ACP countries. In June 1998, however, the EU indicated its intention to phase out preferential sugar prices paid to ACP countries within three years. Under the terms of the Cotonou Agreement, a successor to the fourth Lomé Convention covering the period 2000–2020, the protocol on sugar was to be maintained initially, but would become subject to review within the framework of negotiations for new trading arrangements (negotiations for more WTO-compatible Economic Partnership Agreements—EPAs began in 2002). In 2001 the EU Council adopted the EBA (Everything but Arms) regulation, whereby the least developed countries were granted unlimited duty-free access to the EU for all goods except arms and ammunition. EBA was to apply to sugar from October 2009. Meanwhile, in September 2007 the EU Council of Ministers criticized the protocol on sugar on the grounds that it was not compatible with EU sugar reforms (themselves undertaken in response to upheld complaints before the WTO by Australia, Brazil and Thailand about export subsidies for the ACP countries) and did not take into account the specific needs of different ACP regions. The EU offered duty- and quota-free access to the ACP countries after 2015, in compensation for the loss of subsidies and quotas. A transitional period from October 2009 until September 2015 was to effect the progressive removal of reciprocal trade barriers. However, there was concern that the benefits that ACP countries were intended to derive from unlimited access to the EU market would be undermined by falling sugar prices. It was also uncertain whether some countries that had refused to embrace the EPA arrangements, such as Malawi, would be allowed to continue trading under EBA in order to take advantage of unrestricted access to the EU market sooner (i.e. from 2009 instead of 2015), while sugar prices were still guaranteed to be maintained at a relatively high level. On the basis of data for 2009, the 86 members of the ISO together contributed 83% of world sugar production and 95% of world exports of sugar; ISO members additionally accounted for 69% of global sugar consumption and 47% of world imports. At August 2023 the ISO had 88 members (Madagascar joined in 2014 and Saudi Arabia in 2022, and the United Kingdom had acceded to the ISO independently in 2021), including both the EU and its 27 member states. The ISO is based in London, United Kingdom.

               <b>Prices</b>
       In tandem with world output of cane and beet sugars, stock levels (of centrifugal sugar) are an important factor in determining the prices at which sugar is traded internationally. These stocks, which were at relatively low levels in the late 1980s, had increased significantly, if not consistently, by the 1990s. Stocks increased fairly steadily after 2000, with a peak at some 49m. metric tons at the end of 2014/15, before decreasing over the next two years. Stocks reached a new peak of 54m. tons by the end of 2018/19.

          <p>The World Bank records three sugar prices, to reflect the major markets. The world price that it quotes is the ISA daily price for raw sugar (f.o.b., stowed at greater Caribbean ports); the US price is for sugar under nearby futures contract (c.i.f.); and the increasingly anachronistic EU-negotiated import price for raw, unpackaged sugar from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries under the Lomé Conventions (c.i.f., European ports). Following lower production in 2015/16, output rose significantly in 2016/17–2018/19 (on the back of near-record production in India and Thailand), while consumption remained steady over the same period—causing a weakening of world prices. In 2020, average prices trended upwards before steadying. It was reported that recovering oil prices and an expected sugar supply deficit were pushing prices upwards again in 2021, with prices continuing to rise in 2022 and the first half of 2023 (fuelled, in part, by unusual rainfall in India and by a reduction in petroleum production by OPEC countries placing upward pressure on transportation costs). By August 2023 the ISA world price had increased to US&#160;$528 per metric ton (down from its almost 12-year high in May), while the US price was $893 per ton (down from May, when it had reached its own highest level since the mid-1970s) and the EU price was $356 per ton.</p>

          <p id="ASS.MC.451">Tea is a beverage made by infusing in boiling water the dried young leaves and unopened leaf-buds of the tea plant, an evergreen shrub or small tree. Black (known as red tea in China) and green tea are the most common finished products (white, yellow, oolong and post-fermented tea are also well known). Black tea, which has greater longevity, accounts for the bulk of the world’s supply, and is associated with machine manufacture and plantation cultivation, which guarantees an adequate supply of leaf to the factory. Green tea, produced mainly in the People’s Republic of China and Japan, is grown mostly on smallholdings, and much of it is consumed locally. There are two main varieties of tea, the China and the Assam, although hybrids may be obtained, such as Darjeeling; leaf size is also important, varying between the large Assam leaf and the small China leaf, with a medium Cambodian leaf. In this survey, wherever possible, data on production and trade relate to tea leaves, i.e. dry, unmanufactured tea (green tea and black tea).</p>
          <p>The tea plant can grow up to 16&#160;m, but cultivated ones are usually kept at about waist height, because the leaves and buds harvested are the top 3–5&#160;cm of the plant (known as flushes), every week to a fortnight. Once picked, tea leaves are withered, to preserve them, while black tea is oxidized using either what is known as the orthodox treatment or the CTC (crush, tear, curl) method—the latter means of breaking the leaves also produces the fannings or dust grades that are commonly used in tea bags—before being dried and graded.</p>

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       Of the world crop of tea leaves, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 7% was sold abroad in 2021 (compared with 11% in 2004). Tea production worldwide has increased every year of the 21st century, up to and including 2021, but the growth in exports has been more erratic. Since 2005 China has been the largest producer of tea in the world. Tea exports reached a then record level of 2.05m. metric tons in 2013, although it had declined to only 1.85m. tons in 2015 before recovering in 2016–20, to a new record level of 2.17m. tons in the latter year. Exports were 2.05m. tons in 2021. The major exporting countries, Kenya, China, Sri Lanka and India, have long dominated the market. China and India both have large domestic markets for their tea, but still export substantial amounts. In 2021 Kenya provided 27% of world exports, China 18%, Sri Lanka 14% and India 10% (the next largest exporters were Viet Nam, with 4%, Argentina with 3%, and Indonesia and Rwanda, with some 2% each). Malawi is also an important exporter.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.453">For much of the 20th century India and Sri Lanka were the two leading exporters of tea, with approximately equal sales. During the 1960s India and Sri Lanka together exported more than two-thirds of all the tea sold by producing countries, but their joint foreign sales gradually declined during the 1970s, until they came to constitute less than one-half of world exports (in 2021 some 23%). Over the years Sri Lankan sales came to exceed those of India by a comfortable margin (Indian exports had been exceeded by those of Sri Lanka throughout much of the 2000s—and, indeed, by those of China). Exports by Sri Lanka took primacy in 1997–2004. Kenya was the main tea exporter in 2005–10, but was overtaken by China, India and Sri Lanka the following year. However, in 2013 its foreign sales reached a record high of 448,809 metric tons, which was almost 50% higher than the previous year. Exports by India have been surpassed by those of China (whose sales include a large proportion of green tea) in every year since 1996; in 2011 China resumed its place as Asia’s largest tea exporter for the first time in centuries, although Sri Lanka interrupted that order again the following year. A newer challenge to the four principal exporters came from Viet Nam, which became the world’s fifth largest seller of tea on the international market from 2000, exporting almost twice as much as the Far East’s next largest exporter, Indonesia, in 2021 (although it was almost three times as much in the previous year, when Viet Nam’s exports were more than 50% higher). In 2011 Argentina had exceeded Indonesian sales to become the world’s sixth largest exporter for the first time, maintaining that position in 2012–19, and becoming the world’s seventh largest exporter in 2020. In 2016–20 Uganda was estimated to have sold more tea abroad than Indonesia (and more than Argentina in the latter year), but its exports fell fourfold in 2021 following the Government’s decision to ban the export of raw materials (in order to encourage the domestic manufacturing sector).</p>
          <p>For many years the United Kingdom was the largest single importer of tea. From the late 1980s consumption and imports expanded significantly in developing countries (notably in countries of the Middle East) and, particularly, in the USSR, which in 1989 overtook the United Kingdom as the world’s principal tea importer. However, internal factors following the break-up of the USSR in 1991 caused a sharp decline in tea imports by its successor republics; as a result, the United Kingdom regained its position as the leading tea importer in that year. In 1992–99 the United Kingdom remained the principal destination of tea exports. Since 2000, however, imports by the Russian Federation have exceeded those of the United Kingdom by a substantial and, generally, increasing margin (except in 2001, when the United Kingdom briefly regained its position as the principal importer). In 2021 Russia imported 154,983 metric tons of tea, accounting for 8% of the world market, although Pakistan was the largest importer (a position it had maintained since 2016), buying 260,231 tons. Next, in terms of imports, came the USA with 116,230 tons and the United Kingdom with 108,237 tons. Other major importers of tea in 2021 were Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Iraq.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.460">African exports accounted for 35% of the world total in 2021 (713,820 metric tons). Of total African exports in 2021, 78% came from Kenya. Since 2007 Kenya has consistently been the largest tea exporting nation. In the 1990s and 2000s the conservation of tea supplies by India, in order to satisfy rising domestic consumption, enabled Kenya to replace India as the UK’s principal supplier. In 1999 Kenya provided 50% of British tea imports (by volume), but the proportion varied (46% in 2015). Kenya’s tea sales provided 19% of its total export receipts in 2022, making tea the country’s most valuable export crop. In 2021 some 249,760&#160;ha in Kenya were planted with tea, an increase of 107% since 2000.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.461">Malawi, with an estimated 17,253&#160;ha under tea in 2021, according to the FAO, is generally considered to be Africa’s second largest producer and exporter of tea, although Ugandan production surpassed that of Malawi in 2008 and in most years from 2012, and Ugandan exports exceeded Malawi’s every year from 2010 (until 2021). Malawian exports in 2021 totalled only some 36,798 metric tons, still accounting for 5% of all African tea exports in that year. In 2022 exports of tea accounted for 8% of Malawi’s total export earnings. A great increase in Ugandan exports in 2007–20 challenged Malawi’s position as Africa’s second tea exporter. Prior to the regime of Idi Amin and the nationalization of tea plantations in 1972, Uganda had been second only to neighbouring Kenya among African producers. Uganda’s tea exports were negligible by the early 1980s, but, following agreements between tea companies and the subsequent Ugandan governments, exports were resumed. There has been a sustained recovery since 1990, when sales of tea totalled only 4,760 tons. In 1994 Uganda’s exports of tea reached their highest annual total since 1977. Exports in subsequent years advanced strongly, sometimes varying, but reaching a new record of 72,454 tons in 2020 (9% of the African total). However, following the Government’s ban on exports of raw materials, Uganda exported just 18,064 tons. In 2022 tea exports were reported to contribute just 1.2% of the country’s total export earnings. Still in East Africa, Tanzania’s exports of tea advanced significantly during the 1990s, generally moving above 25,000 tons annually into the 2010s and 2020s; exports were 24,239 tons in 2021. Foreign sales of tea contributed 0.4% of Tanzania’s total revenue from exports in 2022. Tea has traditionally made a significant contribution to the export earnings of Burundi and Rwanda, whose foreign sales were 11,388 tons and 38,867 tons, respectively, in 2021 (the latter country was Africa’s second largest exporter). Since 1997 Rwanda’s tea industry has recovered from the disruption caused by civil unrest during 1993–96. In 2008 surging international commodity prices sent exports of tea to 32% of all exports, up from 17% in the previous year, but the share was a more usual 8% in 2022. Tea provided 13% of total export earnings in Burundi in the same year. Zimbabwe has long been ahead of Burundi in the ranking of Africa’s largest exporters of tea. Historically, however, tea has not been a significant cash crop in Zimbabwe—in 2000 it accounted for only about 1% of the country’s total export earnings (and this contribution declined to just 0.6% in 2022). Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mauritius, Mozambique and South Africa also export some tea.</p>

               <b>International Associations</b>
       An International Tea Agreement (ITA), signed in 1933 by the governments of India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and the Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia), established the International Tea Committee (ITC), based in London, UK, as an administrative body. Although ITA operations ceased after 1955, the ITC has continued to function as a statistical and information centre. In 2023 there were eight producer/exporter members (the tea boards or associations of Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Sri Lanka and Tanzania, and the China Chamber of Commerce of Import and Export of Foodstuffs, Native Produce and Animal By-products), four consumer members (the tea associations of Canada, Ireland, Italy and the USA), 19 associate members and 41 corporate members. In 1969 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) formed a Consultative Committee on Tea (renamed Intergovernmental Group on Tea in 1970), and an exporters’ group, meeting under this committee’s auspices, set voluntary export quotas in an attempt to avert an overall long-term decline in the real price of tea. This succeeded in raising prices for two years, but collapsed subsequently as (mainly) African countries—Kenya in particular—opposed efforts to restrict their rapidly increasing production. The regulation of tea prices is further complicated by the perishability of tea, which impedes the effective operation of a buffer stock.

       Much of the tea traded internationally is sold by auction, principally in the exporting countries. Until declining volumes brought about their termination in June 1998 (Kenya having withdrawn in 1997, and a number of other exporters, including Sri Lanka and Malawi, having established their own auctions), the weekly London auctions in the UK had formed the centre of the international tea trade.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.467">The World Bank provides a number of tea price indexes. The first gives a world price, citing a three auction average, based on quotations at Kolkata (India), Colombo (Sri Lanka) and Mombasa/Nairobi (Kenya). As noted above, Colombo is the largest single auction site for tea in Asia, and the price given is another arithmetic average, this time of weekly quotes for all tea (Sri Lanka, all origins). The Mombasa auctions, dealing in tea from 12 countries, provide the third price, an average of weekly quotes for all tea of African origin. There is also a small auction at Limbe in Cameroon.</p>

          <p id="ASS.MC.469">
      Tobacco originated in South America and was used in rituals and ceremonials or as a medicine; it was smoked and chewed for centuries before its introduction into Europe, the Middle East, Africa and South Asia in the 16th century. The generic name 
      <i>Nicotiana</i>
       denotes the presence of the alkaloid nicotine in its leaves. The most important species in commercial tobacco cultivation is 
      <i>N. tabacum</i>
      . Another species, 
      <i>N. rustica</i>
      , is widely grown, but on a smaller scale, to yield cured leaf for oriental tobacco, snuff or simple cigarettes and cigars.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.474">
      Commercially grown tobacco (from 
      <i>N. tabacum</i>
      ) can be divided into four major types—flue cured (e.g. Virginia, the most grown tobacco variety in the world), air cured (including burley, cigar, light and dark), fire cured and sun cured (including oriental)—depending on the procedures used to dry or `cure’ the leaves. Each system imparts specific chemical and smoking characteristics to the cured leaf, although these may also be affected by other factors, such as the type of soil on which the crop is grown, the type and quantity of fertilizer applied to the crop, the cultivar used, the spacing of the crop in the field and the number of leaves left at topping (the removal of the terminal growing point). Each type is used, separately or in combination, in specific products. All types are grown in Africa.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.475">As in other major producing areas, local research organizations in Africa have developed new cultivars with specific desirable chemical characteristics, disease resistance properties and improved yields. The principal tobacco research centres are in Zimbabwe, Malawi and South Africa. Since the late 20th century efforts have been made to develop low-cost sources of tobacco in Tanzania and, later, in Swaziland and Mozambique.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.476">In Malawi, South Africa and, to a lesser extent, Zambia and Tanzania, tobacco is grown mainly as a direct labour crop on large farms, some capable of producing as much as 250 metric tons of cured leaf per year. In other parts of Africa, however, tobacco is a smallholders’ crop, with each farmer cultivating, on average, 1 or 2&#160;ha of tobacco as well as essential food crops and, usually, other cash crops. Emphasis has been placed on improving yields by the selection of cultivars, by the increased use of fertilizers, by the reduction of crop loss (through the use of crop chemicals) and by reducing hand labour requirements through the mechanization of land preparation and the use of crop chemicals. Where small farmers are responsible for producing the crop, harvesting remains a manual operation, as the area under tobacco and their limited financial means preclude the adoption of mechanical harvesting devices.</p>

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       Between one-third and two-fifths of world tobacco production are traded internationally. Until 1993, when it was overtaken by Brazil, the USA was the world’s principal tobacco exporting country. Since 1993 Brazil has consolidated its position as the world’s leading exporter of tobacco, largely at the expense of the USA and Zimbabwe. Brazil’s share of global exports of unmanufactured tobacco increased in volume from 13% in 1993 to about one-quarter from the mid-2000s (20% in 2021). The principal type of tobacco commercially cultivated in Africa is flue cured, of which Malawi and Zimbabwe are the dominant regional producers. The tobacco sector formerly normally accounted for about almost one-half of Zimbabwe’s total agricultural earnings, and in 2022 unmanufactured tobacco provided 35% of the country’s export revenue. The Zimbabwean tobacco crop, of which 98% has traditionally been exported, is highly regarded for its quality and flavour, and its marketability has been assisted by its relatively low tar content. Output was affected in the early 2000s by the programme of land reform pursued by the Government. In 2005 the number of farmers engaged in tobacco production exceeded 30,000, while the area planted to tobacco was 51,167 ha in the same year; this figure had almost doubled by 2021, reaching 99,029 ha in that year. The increase in the number of farmers reflects an officially encouraged transfer away from the large-scale, estate-based cultivation of tobacco to a smallholder-based sector. As a consequence of land reform, many former estate cultivators of tobacco were reported to have relocated to countries such as Zambia and Mozambique and to have resumed large-scale tobacco cultivation there. Improved prospects for the industry in Zimbabwe were helped by reform of the public subsidy systems on which the sector was reliant and, crucially, by the decision to pay farmers in foreign currency, which helped maintain prices and stability. The tobacco industry was recovering by the 2010s, therefore, with Chinese buyers of increasing importance; they accounted for 22.5% of unmanufactured tobacco sales in 2022.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.478">Malawi is reckoned to be the most tobacco dependent economy in the world. In the mid-1990s Malawi obtained as much as 70% of its export revenue from tobacco, exporting more than 98% of the mainly flue cured, fire cured and burley varieties that it produced. Thereafter, output, especially of burley tobacco, of which Malawi formerly supplied about one-fifth of world output, declined; the country remained the world’s largest producer of burley, which accounted for some 88% of sales by volume in the 2015 Malawi auction season, the bulk of the rest being flue cured. From the early 2000s, however, Malawi was reported to have benefited indirectly from the problems of the tobacco sector in Zimbabwe, and to have attracted increased investment from multinational tobacco companies. In 2022 the country earned 45% of the value of its total exports from unmanufactured tobacco. Three-quarters of employment was reckoned to depend to some extent on the tobacco industry. The industry was badly affected by controversy and recriminations over low prices, with a 2011 collapse in sales leading the authorities to blame a cartel of international buyers for allegedly keeping prices down, while the buyers in turn blamed the Government’s failure to ensure the quality of the leaf. Attention was also focused on the widespread practice of smuggling, and the sale of Malawian tobacco in Zambia and Zimbabwe, where prices were better, leaving the Government deprived of revenue. Sales recovered from 2012, although in 2013 Zimbabwean sales abroad exceeded those of Malawi. Moreover, weaker prices after 2014 hit Malawi hard.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.481">Tanzania contributes a small, but increasing, and significant quantity of flue cured tobacco to the world market, and in 2022 exports of unmanufactured tobacco contributed 3% the country’s total. The sector had been encouraged to expand by the potential of the People’s Republic of China to offset the decline in traditional markets, in particular given that by 2013 it had become apparent that official European Union efforts to discourage smoking would limit the purchase of tobacco from the developing world. Between 2008 and 2014 Tanzania’s export volumes exceeded those of Mozambique, but Mozambican exports have generally been greater in subsequent years. Mozambique was sub-Saharan Africa’s third largest exporter of unmanufactured tobacco after Zimbabwe and Malawi in 2021, followed by Tanzania, Zambia and Uganda. Tobacco production in Nigeria is fairly static, and its flue cured crop is entirely reserved for local consumption. Kenya has greatly increased its output of flue cured leaf since commencing tobacco exports in 1984, and tobacco cultivation has increased in importance in Uganda, as a result of a government programme to offset declining earnings from coffee. Exports of manufactured and unmanufactured tobacco contributed 1% of Uganda’s total export earnings in 2022. There are also small exports of flue cured tobacco from Sierra Leone. Nigeria, Malawi and South Africa account for the African crop of sun cured&#160;and air cured types of tobacco. Modest quantities of oriental tobacco are cultivated in Malawi and South Africa. Côte d’Ivoire also produces some tobacco.</p>

               <b>International Association</b>
       The International Tobacco Growers’ Association (ITGA), with headquarters in Castelo Branco, Portugal, was formed in 1984 by growers’ groups in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Malawi, the USA and Zimbabwe. In 2023 its members numbered 24 countries, including Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. ITGA members account for more than 80% of the world’s internationally traded tobacco. The Association provides a forum for the exchange of information among tobacco producers, conducts research and publishes studies on tobacco issues.

               <b>Prices</b>
       According to the World Bank, general US import prices (c.i.f.) for unmanufactured tobacco of any origin soon recovered from the commodity slump of late 2008 and early 2009, and the average annual price continued to rise until 2011. Prices were fairly stable in 2015, but weakened towards the end of the year and into 2016. From mid-2017 prices climbed steadily, reaching their highest level since May 2015 in August 2018 (US $4,978 per ton), before falling through most of 2019. Prices were steady through most of 2020, only falling below $4,200 per ton in the first two months of 2021. Prices fluctuated in the second half of 2021, but stayed above $4,100 per ton throughout 2022; the average monthly price had reached $4,787 per ton by May 2023 (its highest level since 2019), before falling back to $4,199 per ton in August.

          <p id="ASS.MC.485">
      Uranium occurs in a variety of ores, often in association with other minerals, such as gold, phosphate and copper, and may be mined by open-cast, underground or 
      <i>in situ</i>
       leach methods, depending on the circumstances. An increasing proportion of uranium is produced through 
      <i>in situ</i>
       leaching (57% in 2019). The concentration of uranium that is needed to form an economic mineral deposit varies widely, depending upon its geological setting and physical location. Average ore grades at operating uranium mines vary from 0.03% U to as high as 15% U, but are most frequently less than 1% U. South Africa produces uranium concentrates as a by-product of the mining of gold and copper, and possesses uranium conversion and enrichment facilities. Both copper mining and the exploitation of phosphates by wet (phosphoric acid-yielding) processes offer a more widespread potential for by-product uranium production.
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.486">Uranium is principally used as a fuel in nuclear reactors for the production of electricity. There were 436 commercial nuclear re­act­ors operable in 31 countries worldwide at 1 August 2023, generating 10% of the world’s electricity; 60 more reactors were under construction, with 110 more in planning stages. Enriched uranium is used as fuel in most nuclear power stations and in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. With regard to the latter, however, the abandonment of East–West confrontation and the conclusion of a series of nuclear disarmament treaties between the USA and Russia (and other former Soviet republics) in the late 20th century led to the release from military stockpiles of substantial quantities of uranium for civil energy programmes (although renewed geopolitical tensions between East and West following the Russian Federation’s military invasion of Ukraine in 2022—and the potential for strategic targeting of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in Ukraine—gave rise to concerns that the threat of global nuclear conflict had returned). In 2021 according to data cited by the World Nuclear Association (WNA), the world’s known recoverable resources of uranium (defined as reasonably assured resources plus estimated additional resources, recoverable up to a cost of US&#160;$130 per kg) totalled about 6.08m. metric tons of metal content; some 28% of world resources were located in Australia, 13% in Kazakhstan, 10% in Canada, 8% each in Russia and Namibia, and 5% each in South Africa, Niger and Brazil.</p>

          <p id="ASS.MC.487">
               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       Uranium’s strategic military value led to intense prospecting activity in the 1940s and 1950s, but the market was later depressed as government purchasing programmes ceased. Uranium demand fell in the late 1960s and early 1970s, until industrialized countries responded to the 1973–74 petroleum crisis by intensifying their civil nuclear power programmes. Anticipated strong demand for rapidly expanding nuclear power further improved the uranium market until the early 1980s, when lower-than-expected growth in electricity consumption forced nuclear power programmes to be restricted, leaving both producers and consumers with high levels of accumulated stocks requiring liquidation. A number of mining operations were also scaled down or closed. The market was further depressed in the aftermath of the accident in 1986 at the Chornobyl (Chernobyl) nuclear plant in Ukraine (then part of the USSR). Following a decade of declining output, mined production began to increase from 1993, a general trend it maintained into the 2010s (although global production fell in 2017–18 and 2019–20, before increasing again in 2021–22).
    </p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.489">Kazakhstan and Canada are the world’s largest uranium producers. The six largest mines in the world in 2022 were Cameco’s Cigar Lake (14% of world mine output) in Canada, Swakop Uranium’s Husab in Namibia (7%), Kazatomprom and Cameco’s Inkai in Kazakhstan (7%), Olympic Dam in Australia (6%), Uranium One and Kazatomprom’s Karatau in Kazakhstan (5%) and China National Nuclear Corporation’s Rössing in Namibia (5%). The next largest mine ranked by the WNA was the Arlit or SOMAIR mine (4%) of French company Orano, in Niger. The largest companies in the world in the same year were Kazatomprom (of Kazakhstan, accounting for 23% of world output), Cameco (Canada, 12%), Orano (formerly Areva until early in 2018—11%), China General Nuclear (10%) and Canada-based Uranium One (9%), which is owned by ARMZ Uranium Holding of Russia.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.490">Uranium production has been an important component of the South African mining industry since uranium extraction began in 1951, with output reaching a record 6,146 tons in 1980. South Africa’s production has subsequently declined sharply, and has been overtaken by that of Namibia, Niger and, in 2010–13, Malawi. Namibia’s exports of ores and concentrates of uranium and thorium contribute significantly to its export revenues—some US&#160;$820.8m. in 2022, equivalent to 13.7% of total foreign receipts that year. Deliveries of ore from what was then the world’s largest open-pit uranium mine, at Rössing, had begun in 1976. In 2022 Rössing, operated by Rio Tinto (United Kingdom), was Africa’s second largest uranium mine (5% of global output). Rising extraction at the new Langer Heinrich open-pit mine (opened in 2006), boosted Namibian production from 2008. Niger’s SOMAIR mine was in 2022 the world’s third largest open-pit mine. (The largest was Husab in Namibia.) In 2022 uranium and thorium ores and concentrates provided 35% of Niger’s export earnings, although receipts were 13% less than one year earlier. Uranium exploration in Niger had started in the 1950s, around the Aïr mountains near Agadez, with production commencing at the Arlit mine in 1971. Niger’s other main uranium mine, where operations commenced in 1978, is the Compagnie Minière d’Akouta (COMINAK) mine at Akouta (2% of global output in 2017), also one of Africa’s largest. However, the COMINAK mine ceased operations at the end of March 2021 due to the depletion of its reserves, subdued uranium prices and high operating costs. Like Namibia, Niger was compelled from the early 1990s to restructure and streamline its uranium operations. In 2011 the country became Africa’s largest and the world’s fourth largest producer. The Arlit open-pit mine (operated by Société des Mines de l’Aïr, or SOMAIR, a subsidiary of Orano) ranked just outside the world’s top 10 uranium producing mines in 2021. Gabon, which commenced uranium production in 1958, possesses six identified deposits containing sufficient reserves to support 30 years’ output at production rates achieved during the mid-1990s. However, the depressed level of uranium prices in the late 1990s, with little prospect of recovery in the short term, prompted French interests, exploiting the deposits in conjunction with the Government of Gabon, to terminate uranium mining operations there from early 1999, leaving Namibia, Niger and South Africa as the only regional producers for the next 10 years. Interest remained in Gabon’s Mounana uranium mine, but it was as yet unexploited. However, a uranium mine at Kayelekera in Malawi began production in 2009, increasing output sixfold in 2010 to exceed South African production, only for the weaker uranium price to prompt Australian parent company Paladin to suspend operations at the mine in February 2014. In 2013 uranium or thorium ores and concentrates had provided 11% of total Malawian exports, but less than 3% in 2014 and none from 2015.</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.491">Uranium has also been found, but has been hitherto unexploited, in a number of African countries. In Botswana, the first uranium mine in the country received environmental clearance in 2016; A-Cap of Australia was granted the licence later that year, but due to weak uranium prices commercial production was not expected to begin before the end of 2022. It was reported in mid-2023 that A-Cap would merge with Australian uranium developer Lotus Resources—which manages Malawi’s Kayelekera project—in order to combine the companies’ African uranium assets and meet the growing demands of the uranium market. In the Central African Republic, a mine opened in 2010, with full production initially expected from 2014, but the controversial Areva project was subsequently abandoned. Other countries included the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Tanzania (infrastructure construction was expected at several sites in 2013–18, but in mid-2017 Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom suspended construction of the Mkuju River uranium project for at least three years owing to the underperforming uranium market), Zambia (an Australian company was investigating uranium recovery at a copper mine) and Zimbabwe.</p>

               <b>International Associations</b>
       The World Nuclear Association (WNA), which succeeded the Uranium Institute in 2001, is a global industrial organization that seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear power worldwide as a sustainable source of energy. The WNA concerns itself with all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, including the mining of uranium, its enrichment, the manufacture of nuclear plants and the safe disposal of spent fuel. The Euratom Supply Agency (ESA), established in 1960 under the European Communities’ Euratom Treaty, operates in areas connected with atomic energy, including research, the formulation of safety standards, and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Its main duty is to co-ordinate the supply of nuclear fuels (source materials and special fissile ma­ter­ials) in the European Union (EU), while ensuring a regular and equitable supply of ores and nuclear fuels to all users.

               <b>Prices</b>
       The market for uranium is small, comprising only about 100 buyers worldwide, according to industry sources. Marginal trading, to which `spot’ prices for uranium apply, accounts for only a small proportion of the total quantity of the metal traded, but spot prices nevertheless provide a reference price for long-term contracts concluded between miners and utilities. According to the WNA, very high prices for uranium in the 1970s were succeeded by very low prices in the early 1990s, to the extent that spot prices fell below the cost of production in most mines. In 1996 spot prices reportedly recovered to the extent that most mines were able to produce at a profit. That recovery, however, was succeeded by a further decline which lasted until late 2003. Prices began to rise thereafter, and interest in uranium mining accordingly increased. The ESA provides three price series for natural uranium (U
      <sub>3</sub>
      O
      <sub>8</sub>
      ) delivered to EU utility companies: the long-term price based on the weighted average of the price for uranium delivered under multi-annual contracts; the average weighted spot price of uranium; and the so-called MAC-3 or new multi-annual index, a weighted average of uranium prices paid under multi-annual contracts concluded or amended in the previous three years. All prices are given in euros per kg of uranium and in US dollars per lb of U
      <sub>3</sub>
      O
      <sub>8</sub>
      . The MAC-3 price series began in 2009 (€63.49 per kg, or US&#160;$34.06 per lb). In 2021 the multi-annual contracts index recorded an average annual price of $40.49 per lb, the spot contracts index was unavailable and the MAC-3 was $42.17 per lb (for euro price per kg, see table).

          <!--REVIEW INCLUSION IN ASS FOR 2023 EDITION-->
          <!--This appears again in FEA. Copy it to FEA. FAO not updated (again) so I have changed to USDA entirely - might be more reliable. You will need both the WMPTR (Grains) and the PSD Online database. Use August Grains report. Table: USDA figures for production. As FAO had not been updated, I changed the table to an USDA one, though I quite liked having FAO figures in the table and keeping USDA for the text, but hey ho. The only fly in the ointment is that separate figures for EU countries (notably, France and Germany) have been replaced with a single European Union figure. To compensate, I have included a sentence in the blurb from (slightly older) FAO figures saying what proportion of EU wheat is from France, Germany, etc. WMR text: trade, consumption and regional consumption are all in the USDA Grains WMPTR, but for the country specific stuff you can include the smaller producers and their exports and imports in a PSD Online custom query. For regional totals, you will have to add separate USDA regions of Middle East and North Africa into a single Europa MENA region. USDA sub-Saharan Africa region is the same as Europa one. The country specific stuff is mainly about smaller producers not in our table. Global Forum: IGC website, About Us has a dropdown for Members. It might mention the FACs or Food Assistance Convention, which have a separate paragraph at the end. Keep an eye out for any updates on that in years to come. Prices: use the Pink Sheet data.

      The most common species of wheat (
      <i>Triticum vulgare</i>
      ) includes hard, semi-hard and soft varieties which have different milling characteristics but which, in general, are suitable for bread making. Another species, 
      <i>T. durum</i>
      , is grown mainly in semi-arid areas, including North Africa and the Mediterranean. This wheat is very hard and is suitable for the manufacture of semolina. In North Africa, in addition to being used for making local bread, semolina is the basic ingredient of pasta and couscous. A third species, spelt (
      <i>T. spelta</i>
      ), is also included in production figures for wheat. It is grown in very small quantities in parts of Europe and is used mainly as animal feed.

               <b>The World Market and the Region</b>
       Wheat is the principal cereal in international trade. According to data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), in 2022/23 the European Union (EU) and the People’s Republic of China each accounted for 17% of world wheat production, with India accounting for 13%. France and Germany were the EU’s main producers; according to FAO, in 2021 France accounted for 26% of EU output (5% of the world total), Germany 16% and Poland 9%. The EU was also the leading exporter of wheat for three consecutive production years until 2016/17, when it was third, because the USA, traditionally the world’s leading exporter, reclaimed the top position. However, in 2017/18 the Russian Federation became the leading exporter. The EU regained the top position in 2019/20, but was overtaken by Russia once more in 2020/21; Russia remained the largest exporter in 2021/22–2022/23; in the latter year it contributed a 21% share of international trade (with the EU exporting around 16% and the USA 10%). The strength of Russia as an exporter is that it has a relatively small internal market, as do Canada (12%) and Ukraine (8%). Russia and Ukraine alone account for close to one-third of total wheat supplies on the global market. Meanwhile, Australia saw its exports of wheat more than double in 2020/21, and exports increased again in 2021/22 and 2022/23; in the latter year it contributed 15% of the global total. Any significant decline in production in the other major producers, notably China and India, can impact hugely on world trade through their consequent need for greater imports. In 2022/23 USDA estimated the largest importing region, by far, to be the Middle East and North Africa (32% of world imports), followed by East Asia (12%), sub-Saharan Africa (as defined by USDA, all African states except the five Mediterranean littoral countries—also 12%), South-East Asia (almost 12%), South Asia (higher than usual in that year—India replenishing stocks after poor harvests in previous years—just over 6%) and South America (almost 6%). Developed countries were formerly the principal consumers of wheat, but the role of developing countries as importers has been steadily increasing and they now regularly account for approximately two-thirds of world imports.
    </p>
          <p>World consumption, which has, in the long term, been increasing at a similar rate to production, varies much less from year to year than the wheat harvest. Wheat food use has been expanding at the expense of rice: its growth is associated with rising consumer incomes and an increasing number of fast-food outlets. Substantial amounts of wheat are used for animal feed in Europe and, when prices are favourable, in North America. Substantial quantities were also used for feed in the 1980s in what was then the USSR, but this volume decreased sharply in response to the diminution in livestock numbers. Some wheat is used for feed in Japan, while the Republic of Korea (South Korea) imports wheat for feed when prices are low in comparison with those of coarse grains such as sorghum and maize (corn). According to USDA, domestic consumption of wheat was highest in the EU until 2010/11, but is now generally exceeded by East Asia and, from 2016/17, South Asia. At 2022/23 the largest consuming region was East Asia (20%), followed by South Asia (almost 20%), the Middle East and North Africa (14%) and the EU (almost 14%).</p>
          <p id="ASS.MC.502">In Africa, wheat is principally grown in the south and east of the continent, often at high altitudes where conditions are less humid. South Africa was traditionally the main regional producer, but it was surpassed by Ethiopia in 2003/04 (according to USDA), hitherto the second largest regional producer. Ethiopia, however, grows for a domestic market, while South Africa is the more important exporter of wheat (320,000 tons in 2022/23—32% of the sub-Saharan total), although on a small scale compared with major producers elsewhere in the world. The continent’s principal exporter, on paper, was Nigeria (40% of the sub-Saharan total), because it had taken on a similar role to Côte d’Ivoire as a re-exporter for West Africa. In some other wheat producing countries (e.g. Tanzania and Zimbabwe) the crop is grown mainly on large commercial farms and, with the benefit of irrigation, usually yields well. Efforts to produce wheat in tropical countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Nigeria have shown mixed results. In the case of the DRC, production declined at least partially because of the prevalence of civil unrest rather than purely agricultural considerations. Zimbabwean wheat output, similarly, was negatively affected by the Government’s land reform programme in the 2000s. By the 2010s the country’s wheat output was recovering. Indeed, in 2022/23, according to preliminary USDA figures, the country produced 175,000 tons (compared to just 62,000 tons six years earlier). The surge in output was attributed to a Government scheme that brought in private sector investment and expertise (including much-needed machinery and financing). Lesotho, although a much smaller country, is an elevated one with a suitable climate for growing wheat. The country produced just 6,000 tons in 2022/23. Harvests in southern Africa in the mid-2010s were generally severely reduced because of sustained drought caused by the El Niño weather phenomenon. In 2022/23 Eritrea and Uganda each grew some 25,000 tons of wheat, Mali grew 22,000 tons and Mozambique produced 16,000 tons. The only other sub-Saharan grower of wheat of any significance was Sudan (most of the country’s wheat growing areas are outside what became South Sudan in July 2011), although it exported little. Rwanda increased its wheat production in the 2000s, in particular latterly, reaching a peak of 90,684 tons in 2011, although according to USDA output since then has dropped.</p>

               <b>Global Forum</b>
       The International Grains Council (IGC) is based in London, United Kingdom. It is the successor body of the International Wheat Council (IWC). From 1949 nearly all world trade in wheat was conducted under the auspices of successive international agreements, administered by the IWC. The early agreements involved regulatory price controls and supply and purchase obligations, but such provisions became inoperable in more competitive market conditions, and were abandoned in 1972. The IWC subsequently concentrated on providing detailed market assessments to its members and encouraging them to confer on matters of mutual concern. A new Grains Trade Convention, which entered into force in July 1995, gave the renamed IGC a wider mandate to consider all coarse grains as well as wheat (rice was added to the definition of grains from 1 July 2009 and oilseeds from 1 July 2013). This facilitates the provision of information to member governments, and enhances their opportunities to hold consultations. In addition, links between governments and industry are strengthened at an annual series of grain conferences sponsored by the IGC. In August 2023 the IGC consisted of 29 member countries, plus the EU.

               <b>Prices</b>
       Hard Red Winter is one of the most widely traded wheat varieties. The export price of US No. 1 Hard Red Winter (ordinary protein, delivered at Gulf ports for prompt or 30 days shipment) is cited by the World Bank as an indicator. Average monthly prices ended below US&#160;$300 per metric ton for the first time in 18 months at the end of 2013 and remained below that level from July 2014. One year later average monthly prices fell below $200 per ton and stayed below that level for the whole of 2017 (with the exception of July). The price began to recover in early 2018, but by mid-2019 the price had fallen below $200 per ton for the second time that year. It recovered strongly thereafter, reaching its highest level in five years—$225 per ton—in January 2020. Prices continued to increase throughout 2021 and the first half of 2022; in May of the latter year the price soared to its highest level on record—fuelled by Russia’s renewed military invasion of Ukraine (and the resultant supply disruptions in the latter country as the ongoing hostilities resulted in an effective blockade of Ukrainian ports, preventing crucial grain exports) and an Indian export ban (intended to regulate inflated domestic prices)—and prompting widespread fears of a developing global humanitarian crisis in those countries where these wheat imports were a critical food staple. Prices only began to decline in July 2022 following a UN-backed agreement, brokered by Türkiye between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, to allow the resumption of grain exports from Ukrainian Black Sea ports. However, in July 2023 it was reported that Russia had withdrawn from the agreement, prompting renewed fears of dramatic price increases that might jeopardize global food security. Notwithstanding Russia’s withdrawal, in July and August the price actually fell, to average $316 per ton in the latter month—a consequence of a large Russian harvest.

               <b>The Food Aid Conventions and the Food Assistance Convention</b>
       Since 1967 a series of Food Aid Conventions (FACs), linked to the successive Wheat and Grains Trade Conventions, have ensured continuity of supplies of food aid in the form of cereals to countries in need. Under the last FAC, negotiated in 1999, the donor countries (including the member states of the EU) pledged to supply a minimum of some 5m. metric tons of food aid annually to developing countries, with priority given to least developed countries and other low-income food-importing countries. Aid was provided mostly in the form of cereals, and all aid given to least developed countries was in the form of grants. The FAC sought to improve the effectiveness, and increase the impact, of food aid by improved monitoring and consultative procedures. In mid-2004 FAC members undertook a renegoti­ation of the 1999 FAC in order `to strengthen its capacity to meet identified needs when food aid is the appropriate response’. However, it was decided that this renegoti­ation should await the conclusion of discussions on trade-related food aid issues in agriculture negotiations at the World Trade Organization. Meanwhile, it was agreed to extend the 1999 FAC for two years from July 2005; further, one-year extensions were agreed subsequently and it only finally expired on 30 June 2012. In December 2010 formal negotiations on the future of the FAC had commenced, so the extensions were to give the discussions a fair chance of fruition. A new Food Assistance Convention was adopted in London on 25 April 2012, and was open for signature from 11 June to the 34 signatories and the EU. It came into force on 1 January 2013 (after ratification by six signatories—Canada, Denmark, the EU, Japan, Switzerland and the USA), and from that date was open to other signatories. Rather than focusing only on certain specified food items (expressed in wheat-equivalent tons), the new instrument focused on `nutritious food’, leaving it up to the parties to express commitments in wheat tons or monetary terms, as part of the mechanisms for information sharing and registration of undertakings.
